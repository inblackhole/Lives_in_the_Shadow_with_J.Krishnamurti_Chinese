    While Krishna's new direction was unsettling to some and exciting  to others, Mrs Besant in her old age and with her mind very taken  up with the movement for Indian Home Rule and the troubles she  correctly foresaw for India's future, was more and more confused by  him. She was also, as we have learned from her letter of 17 June 1926  to Leadbeater, trying her utmost to reconcile the factions in the society  and still allow Krishna to go his own way. At the end of that summer  she was sufficiently upset by the differing factions around her to consider  resigning as President of the society, but she decided instead to make an  unscheduled visit to America. For years Krishna and Nitya had wanted  to show her ?(r)their' Ojai valley. Perhaps she sensed that it would now be  sad for Krishna to return to the place where they had last been together  and where Nitya had died. 
    Among the passengers on the SS Majestic, bound for New York, was  a group of actors, including Lillian Gish, John Barrymore and members  of the New York Theater Guild, who exhibited polite curiosity about  the strikingly handsome young ?(r)messiah'. There would always be an  interest in Krishna among the Hollywood film set. This casual shipboard  encounter would lead to occasional further meetings. Some years later  John Barrymore, on a visit to Arya Vihara, went so far as to suggest  that Krishna would make a good film actor portraying the life of  Buddha. This remark, tossed out as it happened when Barrymore was  in his cups, seems to have made a surprising impression on Krishna.  He later claimed he had been offered the part at five thousand dollars  a week and knew he could always have made a living that way if he  had to. 
    In spite of the glamorous competition for limelight on board, Mrs  Besant and her party were greeted with a barrage of innuendoes from  the press on their arrival in New York. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was  currently running with great success on Broadway and this added  colourful spice to the press stories in which Rosalind was romantically  linked with Krishna as the mysterious blonde in his retinue. Mrs Besant 
    87      suspected that an old adversary in the early days of the Theosophical  Society, Mme Tingley, might have started the rumours. 
    At this point, no doubt to Mrs Besant's relief, Rosalind and Raja  decided to announce their engagement. Raja had convinced Rosalind of  his love for her and she had felt a deep affection for him even while Nitya  was alive, but she still had certain reservations about marrying him.  His increasingly serious nature and sometimes depressed temperament  worried her, as did his habit of working all day and most of the night  in his total commitment to ?(r)the Work'. But that summer, walking on  Wimbledon Common, he had eloquently assured her that he would  change if she married him. 
    Krishna kept himself aloof from the large step his two close friends  were about to take. His manner toward them both was cool and  withdrawn, but he offered no overt indication of his opinion at that  time, quite unlike his attitude towards others who had married or  announced engagements and received the full blast of his horror. When  he heard his old friend Marcelle de Manziarly was engaged he had  responded that she was a fool and might just as well commit suicide. 
    Perhaps he looked on Raja and Rosalind's engagement as a matter of  expediency, done for his sake, to stop the rumours and not something  of their own choosing. Or perhaps he did not take it seriously. 
    When Mrs Besant heard that Orientals could not become American  citizens and that American women who married Orientals would lose  their citizenship, she was so outraged that she asked them to call off  their engagement, which they did. It is ironical that England should  have been less bigoted in this respect. (It was not until after the Second  World War that Raja obtained US citizenship.) 
    For Krishna, who had been away from Ojai for nearly a year, their  arrival was full of sad nostalgia. Arya Vihara was the place where he and  Nitya had been most happy together and the place they had considered  their home. He felt his brother's presence strongly, especially in the  front bedroom where Nitya had died. 
    Life in California was austere. Arya Vihara still sparsely furnished  with only fireplaces for warmth. Krishna slept up in Pine Cottage,  Mrs Besant, Raja and Rosalind in the large house, which Rosalind ran  with ease after her year in Sydney. 
    One evening after dinner they were all assembled in the living-room  at Arya Vihara. Krishna was leaning against the fireplace and started to  explain to Mrs Besant how his consciousness had now merged with the  ?(r)beloved', something more than the Lord Maitreya, in fact possibly the  Buddha. Raja remembers the distress on Mrs Besant's face as she tried 
    88  
 
                   
Bypassing the Masters 
    to comprehend this new concept which was not at all part of the plan  intricately laid out to her and Leadbeater by the Masters and in which  she so fervently believed. 
    Afterwards, walking with Krishna back to Pine Cottage as he did  every evening, Raja too felt very disturbed by the discussion he had  just witnessed. He had accepted Mrs Besant's and Leadbeater's view  of Krishna as a vehicle for the Lord Maitreya, but not as a merged  consciousness. This distinction was quite naturally of great importance  to Krishna. Being ?(r)one flame' with the Lord is preferable to being merely  an available vehicle, even if the result appeared to be the same to his  enraptured audiences. 
    Worried as she was by this change in Krishna's perception, Mrs  Besant concluded that she would have to accept whatever he said.  She had really put herself in this position by her unfailing outward  loyalty to him, though between her and Leadbeater there had been  moments of grave doubts which tended to be overruled by her love  for Krishna. This love was soon further demonstrated, for when his  plans to go to India with her in November had to be cancelled due  to a painful swelling in his breast, resulting in the doctor's firm orders  that he must stay in Ojai, she decided to remain there with him for  the winter. 
    She never fully resigned herself to his ?(r)blending of consciousness'  theory. But at the same time, she gave him her unflinching public  support and did her utmost to reconcile the two views. 
    [she reviewed] the development of her and Leadbeater's original  theory of the taking over of a human body by the Teacher, and  [told] how in London recently she had modified this theory in  accordance with modern psychology to allow for ?(r)dual personality.  and had'now come to think that there would not be ?(r)a going out and  a coming in . . . but a thing far more inspiring . . . a blending of the  consciousness of the Christ with the consciousness of His Disciple',  a ?(r)taking of the manhood into God.?¡À? 
    The state of Krishna's consciousness was not absorbing Mrs Besant's  entire interest that winter. She was also embarking on a serious real  estate venture. One day she had been taken to the upper valley to see  a tract of land, purchased the year before for the Order of the Star.  However, Krishna and Raja had found the rolling hills unsuitable for  a campsite. Besides there was no water. As Mrs Besant sat on the land  under the grove of eucalyptus trees she had a very strong ?(r)vision' or 
    89      conviction that this would be the perfect centre for the future sixth  sub-root race. She and Leadbeater had for some years seen California as  a fertile area for this new generation with an advanced consciousness to  develop. It became of the utmost importance to her to appoint trustees  who would preserve the land for the right moment. When this moment  would come or what type of activity would manifest itself was left  sufficiently vague to allow for many possibilities. But she suggested  any number of potential uses ranging from agricultural enterprises  to schools and communities to film-making, all in the interests of  strengthening the forces of peace and the spiritual as well as physical  and intellectual progress of mankind. 
    She envisioned a natural link under the guidance of the Masters  between the work of the world teacher and the community that would  eventually flourish in Happy Valley. But each would be separate in  entity and location. She and Krishna agreed that she would give the  Order of the Star a cheque for the upper land, which would cover  whatever money had already been raised for its purchase. The Order  of the Star could then acquire a more suitable site for the Star camps  that had been found at the other end of the valley. Mrs Besant named  the land Happy Valley as she said it reminded her of a beautiful valley  in the Himalayas. She also had in mind that state of being that Krishna  had called the Kingdom of Happiness. 
    Among the original trustees of Happy Valley, were Raja, Sara and  Robert Logan, an eminent Philadelphia couple, and Louis Zalk, a Duluth  businessman. No one, Mrs Besant least of all, could have foreseen that  two years later Krishna would sever his ties with all organizations, the  Masters and their plans for him. In his defection he would take with him  many of the subscribers who had pledged themselves to help pay off the  heavy mortgage on Happy Valley. Many other contributors would be hit  by the Great Depression. Thus it would fall primarily on the Logans and  Louis Zalk to keep afloat financially this beautiful but empty acreage.  Happy Valley would remain serenely undisturbed for the next twenty  years, waiting for Mrs Besant's vision to shape into reality. 
    There was to be another pre-camp gathering at Eerde Castle in July  1927, which Mrs Besant planned to attend after her round of European  lectures. At the last moment Krishna privately persuaded her not to  come and, as usual, she complied with his wishes although she was  puzzled. Krishna must have known then what he was going to say  at Eerde and known that it would have been more difficult for  him to say it in her presence. Possibly he wanted to spare her hurt, 
    90

    but nothing could have hurt her more than the way he handled this  request. _ 
    Mrs Besant unexpectedly then asked Rosalind to stay with her in  London. Rosalind had become very close to her and did many small  personal things which Mrs Besant had come to find a comfort, such  as brushing her hair and driving her. In Ojai the previous winter Mrs  Besant had come to rely on Rosalind for night driving especially, saying  she felt safest with her at the wheel. But this change in plans was a terrible  disappointment for Rosalind, who had been looking forward to seeing  all her old friends. She had also come to look on Krishna and Raja as  her family and knew she would be desperately lonely without them.  Yet she would not have dreamed of arguing with Mrs Besant or even  of showing the least reluctance. Miss Dodge must have realized that for  a young woman of high spirits to be left in a household of elderly ladies  for the summer was not too exciting a prospect. She did everything she  could to make up for it, arranging theatre tickets and parties and escorts,  none of whom interested Rosalind. These occasions, in fact, gave her a  life-long distaste for English upper-class society and a distrust of wealth.  When Miss Dodge, who then, reportedly, had an income ofa million  dollars a year, wanted to adopt her, Rosalind declined, not only out  of loyalty to her own mother but because she had an innate fear of  so much wealth. Miss Dodge nevertheless showed her great fondness  for Rosalind by setting up for her, as she had for Krishna and Raja, a  lifetime trust. 
    While Rosalind was convinced that Mrs Besant wanted her presence  for comfort, it is more probable that as the rumours linking Krishna  romantically with Rosalind were again in the air, now that her engage- ment with Raja had been broken, Mrs Besant had decided to keep  them apart for the summer. When she finally went to Holland she  left Rosalind behind in London. ?(r)Even among Theosophists . . . there  were strong rumours that Krishna was actually in love at the time  and that Mrs Besant had to exert heavy pressure to remind him  of his duty as a celibate . . . the girl named was . . . Rosalind  Williams.. 
    Mrs Besant had another forewarning of Krishna's increasingly inde- pendent thinking. On a quick trip to Paris, where he spoke to the  Esoteric Society, he referred to the Masters as ?(r)mere incidents'. 
    Meanwhile in Ommen Raja and Lady Emily were busy changing  the name of the Herald to the Star Review (since the world teacher was  now officially here, Herald was no longer an appropriate name), and  with Krishna's full approval, they drafted new objectives: 
    9  
 
                   
 
    1 To draw together all those who believe in the presence in the 
    world of the World Teacher. 
    2 To work with him for the establishment of His ideals. The Order 
    has no dogmas, creeds, or systems of belief. Its inspiration is the 
    Teacher, its purpose to embody His universal life. 
    Both George Arundale and Jinarajadasa were in hearty disagreement  with the idea of the merging of Krishna's consciousness with that of  the world teacher. This was to place Krishna, who was in their opinion  still a disciple, too close to the Lord. This controversy would never be  effectively resolved. While under Krishna's sway, Jinarajadasa might  appear to concede. But he would later revert to his own opinion. His  undying love for Krishna in spite of this very great difference between  them placed him in a difficult position. He saw in Krishna's view  the destruction of the whole Theosophical plan of the brotherhood,  the Masters and ?(r)the Path', which he now felt Krishna was trying  to bypass. 
    But Krishna was not deterred by any of these opinions. A few days  before Camp was to open he addressed the host representatives of  forty countries. He maintained that his consciousness was merged with  his beloved, by which he meant all of creation. He went further in  recommending that his listeners give their attention only to the truth,  not to outer forms or authorities. He did not deny that he was the world  teacher, only that he had ever said so. Nevertheless, in his reiteration  of being one with his beloved the audience was certainly led to believe  that he had attained a very lofty level and that it was his desire to help  others to the same attainment. 
    During Mrs Besant's stay there were no evident divisive incidents.  As soon as she left, however, Krishna spoke to a special Service Camp  session in which he went even further; so far, in fact, that no printed  record remains, leading some to speculate that it was later suppressed  because of Mrs Besant's disapproval. But several witnesses clearly  remember that he claimed he had never read a Theosophical book  and could not understand Theosophical jargon nor had any of the  Theosophical lectures convinced him of their knowledge of the truth. If  this were true, one wonders how Krishnajustified keeping these attitudes  from his devoted Theosophical protectors for the past fifteen years. 
    The effect of this statement on Mrs Besant was powerful. Back  in London Rosalind remembers a cablegram arriving. She saw Mrs  Besant's face blanch as she read it and then the suddenly old woman  withdrew to her room and did not emerge for three days, refusing to 
    92

    eat. Rosalind had never seen her ill, indeed Mrs Besant's reputation  for incredible physical stamina was legendary. 
    Mrs Besant knew that many Theosophists were as badly shaken as  she was and she wondered if Krishna's present spirit was destructive.  This view of the dichotomy of Krishna's consciousness, reinforced by  his own words and actions, would follow him for the rest of his life. 
    In London, Rosalind had become so noticeably lonely that Miss Dodge  urged her to telephone Raja in Ommen. His response to this commu- nication was to turn up the next day with a sprig of orange blossoms in  his hand. That romantic gesture dispelled any lingering doubts Rosalind  might have had. 
    They talked their plans over with Mrs Besant, who said she wanted  to give away the bride and to have the wedding in London before her  return to India. She immediately went to her calendar and picked a date,  11 October, ten days after her own birthday. Neither the deep concern  she was wrestling with over Krishna, her busy lecture schedule, or all the  work involved with her plans to return to India, prevented Mrs Besant  from giving time and consideration to Rosalind's wedding. It was to  be a large affair, in St Mary's Liberal Catholic church, following a civil  ceremony a week earlier on 3 October 1927 at the Registrar's office. 
    Although he could easily have planned to, Krishna did not show  up for either of these occasions. He was in London for Mrs Besant's  eightieth brithday on 1 October, but claimed something important drew  him away to Paris; possibly his sittings for the bust being made of him  by the great French sculptor, Bourdelle. Perhaps he just abhorred the  idea of weddings, but Rosalind felt keenly his disapproval toward both  her and Raja. 
    The arrangements for the wedding were completely out of Rosalind's  hands: the guest list, her bouquet, her white velvet gown. No loving  mother could have planned it all with more care. Mrs Besant asked the  chauffeur to circle for what seemed to Rosalind an cternity to allow the  traditional tardiness of the bride of five or ten minutes, while a very  nervous young groom waited at the altar. 
    What came next for the newlyweds was less a honeymoon than a  lecture tour which Raja was to give throughout Europe. Afterwards  he and Rosalind returned to Ojai and Arya Vihara, their home for the  next forty-five years. 
    Meanwhile Krishna returned to India, as planned, with Mrs Besant.  Here she did not allow her confusion to show itself to the public. She 
    93  
 
                   
 
      appeared at least partially to have accepted Krishna's view of himself,  for she granted that his consciousness had blended with a fragment of  the world teacher. While Krishna was not about to content himself with  a ?(r)fragment', George Arundale begrudged him even that, feeling that his  own knowledge of the Lord made it unlikely that Krishna had even that  fragment. 
    Leadbeater more or less kept his own counsel at this time, treading  the narrow ledge between Mrs Besant and Krishna on the one hand  and George Arundale and his faction on the other. Krishna had the  impression that Leadbeater was totally behind him, even ?(r)reverential'  toward him. But others witnessed that ?(r)Leadbeater privately wished  that Krishna would *?(r)leave us alone to go on with our work?¡À and  was declaring that ?¡ãthe Coming has gone wrong.?¡À "4 
    Krishna was to become increasingly hostile towards George Arundale,  although always claiming that it was George who had feelings against  him. Rukmini declared later that her husband George had no per- sonal grudge at all against Krishna, indeed had once loved him and  would have continued to do so had Krishna not turned on him. But  he did see Krishna's behaviour at that time as destructive for the  society.? 
    It soon became apparent that Krishna did not have as much influence  either on Leadbeater or on Mrs Besant as he might have hoped. They  suddenly launched a new vehicle in the shape of the world mother.  And who was to fill this role? None other than Rukmini! Typically,  memories and memos of the time often differ. 
    As Rukmini Devi recalled it, she had no warning of what was to  happen . . . when I interrogated Krishnamurti himself about the  whole World Mother affair, he blurted out, ?(r)Oh, that was all cooked  u¡Ð before he caught himself in the realisation that he was admitting  to a recollection of events in his early life which he later came to deny  he possessed . . . 
    What was going on in the mind of Rukmini Devi Arundale while  these remarkable things were happening to her is almost as fascinating  a tale as what was going on in the mind of Krishnamurti when he  realised the role for which he had been selected. A direct answer,  however, 1s possible in her case as it is not in his, because she frankly  and generously told her story to me one evening as we sat on the lawn  of her bungalow on the bank of the darkening Adyar River, whereas  Krishnamurti sitting cross-legged on the floor of his bare room on  the opposite side [of the river] insisted that he had forgotten his early 
    94

    life as the result of his final breaking with his past in the Theosophical 
    Society.. 
    But the world mother was an even shorter-lived project than the world  teacher. Rukmini herself never felt an inner direction toward the role  and was instead to turn her considerable talents toward humanitarian  and artistic pursuits which would make a great contribution to her  country. 
    Krishna, no matter what his later memories or non-memories may  have been, did not take kindly to this new vehicle. He did not want  to be dragged into this new business any more than he had wanted  to be involved with the apostles incident. He blamed George for the  whole affair. It was reasonable for him to have assumed that George  was heavily involved in the world mother programme, but it had been  initially Leadbeater's idea. The whole situation hardened Krishna in his  determination to make a complete break with the society.
