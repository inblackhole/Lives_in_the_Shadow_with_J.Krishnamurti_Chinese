    A Left Turn 
    After receiving his MA and LLB Raja found himself at a critical point  in his life. He had just been offered a postgraduate place at Cambridge.  His tutor, of whom he had become very fond, was encouraging him to  accept it. But Mrs Besant asked him to give up the offer and help in the  work for the coming world teacher. She still believed, as did Leadbeater,  that Krishna was no more than the vehicle for this coming and that there  was yet a great deal of preparation to be made. Raja complied with her  request and declined the offer from Cambridge, not hesitating to follow  the path she advocated. 
    Krishna had cancelled the Ommen camp for that summer of 1925,  realizing that because of Nitya's health they would have to remain in  Ojai. It was an indication of the growing rift between him and George  Arundale that Arundale decided to run it anyway, saying he and others  could carry on the Master's work without Krishna there. 
    In July, before the camp was to start, George had gathered a group  at Huizen in Holland. At his urging Mrs Besant had changed her plans  in order to join them there as extraordinary initiations were said to  be taking place. George announced the acceleration of his young wife  Rukmini's advancement along ?(r)the Path'. 
    Raja accompanied Mrs Besant, Lady Emily and Shiva Rao on the night  train to Huizen. In an atmosphere of intense excitement, he received his  second initiation and was made a deacon in the Liberal Catholic Church.  He would also be considered as one of twelve apostles. Although there  was some confusion as to who exactly the twelve were, they included  Mrs Besant, Leadbeater, Jinarajadasa, George, Rukmini, Nitya, Raja  and Lady Emily. 
    One day during this time at Huizen, Rukmini and Raja were alone  with Mrs Besant, taking their initiation in the Co-Masonic Lodge, when  suddenly Rukmini was overcome by giggles which soon infected Raja.  They struggled with their hands over their faces to conceal this from  Mrs Besant, never feeling certain whether she noticed or not. According  to Rukmini, Raja had always been shy but was trying to get over it, 
    74  
 
                   
A Left Turn 
    as Leadbeater said shyness was a form of pride. In spite of the giggles  Rukmini felt that from this time on Raja's nature changed. He told her  then that he wished his character to develop more in the direction of  Mrs Besant's, to become more serious and purposeful.! 
    Raja's furtherinitiations were abruptly interrupted when Krishna wrote  asking him to come immediately to California to help with Nitya. After  consulting with Mrs Besant, who said he should go if he wished, Raja left  Huizen on 3 August, arriving in Ojai on 24 August. He found Rosalind  and Krishna exhausted. Nitya had recently suffered another serious  haemorrhage. Rosalind was still the one to carry the major burden  of nursing Nitya, and the presence of Raja under these grave and sad  circumstances would be the cornerstone for a long-lasting relationship  between Krishna, Rosalind and him. 
    Meanwhile in Holland the scene of spiritual advancements had moved  from Huizen to the Ommen Camp, where it was disclosed that Krishna  and Rukmini had arrived at the fourth or arhat level of initiations and  were therefore allowed to ask special boons. According to George  Arundale, who seemed to have a unique vantage point from the astral  plane, Krishna had asked for Nitya's life and Rukmini for a closer union  between England and India. The first of these wishes would be denied,  the second delayed for many years. Nevertheless, the wheels were still  grinding and on the last day of camp it was announced that Mrs Besant,  Leadbeater, Krishna, Jinarajadasa and Arundale had all taken their fifth  and final initiation Ал but they still expected to be treated as before by  those struggling along on the lower levels. 
    In Ojai, Raja found that Krishna was very disturbed by what he  had heard of the happenings at Huizen and had already written to  question Lady Emily as to whether or not Leadbeater had confirmed  them. Leadbeater had, in fact, cast serious doubt and disapproval on  the whole business and would continue to do so. Krishna had not  revealed in his letters to Mrs Besant how strongly he felt, although  he had written of his distress to Lady Emily, asking her to destroy  these letters for fear of revealing to others his criticism of Mrs Besant,  who was now taking full authority for the proclamations. 
    Apparently Krishna did not believe in or approve of the idea of the  apostles or the rapid imtiations which had taken place. However, he  said he still believed in the Masters, and believed that they would not  let anything happen to Nitya as they had stated that he was essential  to ?(r)the Work'. 
    The strain of seeing his brother so ill sometimes caused Krishna to  needle him into a will to live. Once he even told him that in a vision 
    75      the Mahachohan himself had said that Nitya must pull himself together  and get well or he might die. Raja found such tactics as surprising  as the frequent tension between the brothers, which he could not  avoid noticing. One afternoon, when Krishna was in the living-room  discussing some arrangements with a young Theosophist, Nitya became  quite agitated and asked Raja to ?(r)go and keep an eye on Krishna and  see what he is up to'. It is probable that Nitya alone realized the  seriousness of the inner revolution that was simmering in Krishna and  which sometimes boiled over in the form of increasing disrespect toward  the Theosophical leaders. With Mrs Besant unquestioningly accepting  George's announcements about the initiations, with Leadbeater isolated  in Australia, and with Nitya evidently untouched by the doubts which  were more and more besetting him, Krishna was certainly in a delicate  position. Having been proclaimed an arhat, even though he had to  share that distinction with Rukmini, was he then to question the whole  performance at Huizen and Ommen? It must have become clear to him  at about this time that he would have to find a way out for himself  from what he saw as a rapid descent towards the ridiculous. 
    Mrs Besant had expressed the hope that Krishna would attend the  Theosophical Jubilee in Adyar that autumn. It was still of utmost  importance to him not to offend her and he had yet to work out the  careful course he must tread through the polarizing factions within the  society. By October he felt there was enough improvement in Nitya's  health to allow him to comply with Mrs Besant's wishes. Raja, who  was expected to go too, was surprised by Krishna's insistence that  Rosalind should leave Nitya and accompany them. Rosalind was most  reluctant to do so. Without her knowledge, Krishna had arranged for  Mme de Manziarly to come from India and arrive in time to take over  the care of Nitya while they were all away. Considering, in that age of  travel, the time involved that it would take to implement such plans,  it certainly was not a last-minute decision. According to her daughter  Mima, Mme de Manziarly knew the moment she saw Nitya that he  was dying. Probably Nitya knew too. But Krishna, whether by fact  or illusion said he had received in person, direct confirmation, not only  from the Masters, but from the Mahachohan himself, that Nitya's life  was essential to ?(r)the Work', therefore he could not die. Also, he and  Rosalind had both been assured by Dr Strong that ?(r)the thread of life  was turning upward and that Nitya would live'. 
    Rosalind, suffering from an acute case of urticaria, a severe skin rash  brought on by exhaustion, had allowed herself to be reassured by this  too. She had been caring for Nitya night and day for many months 
    76  
 
                   
A Left Turn 
    without a break. It was a tragic error Ал certainly for those who loved  Nitya and would have wanted to be with him to the end. 
    One day Nitya talked very seriously to both Raja and Rosalind, asking  them to promise that no matter what the difficulties, they would always  stay with Krishna. Later they would look on this as a solemn deathbed  promise. In the far distant future this vow would prove to be a terrible  millstone around Raja's neck. 
    On the day of departure, Rosalind, distraught and exhausted and still  reluctant to leave, threw her things in a suitcase and ran out of the house,  not even noticing that she had no proper shoes until she was on the way  to the railway station. Mary Gray kindly took her own shoes off her  feet and gave them to her. 
    The voyage to England calmed and rested them. Although Raja did  not completely share Krishna's evolving doubts, by standing with  Krishna at this moment he and Rosalind were together taking a new  direction which would drastically alter their lives. Yet they had and  would continue to have quite separate views of Krishna, just as they  had of Theosophy. 
    Rosalind had never espoused the occult aspects of Theosophy and  had not herself even joined the society. Erma had in fact joined her  up as a life member. But if Rosalind was aware of this at all at the  time, she would later forget it. She had a tremendous love and respect  for many Theosophists, Mrs Besant, Miss Dodge and several others,  to say nothing of her own sister Erma, and would not have let any  difference of belief impose on those relationships. 
    She had reservations about Krishna where his role as the vehicle was  concerned. One would have to believe that there are Masters in order  to believe that they had chosen him to be the vehicle for the incarnation  of the Lord Maitreya. Rosalind had neither denied nor accepted this  belief buthad simply watched, without feeling either intellectually or  spiritually involved. Her background may have played a role in this  attitude. Even if she had not been sceptical by nature, her father had  been during most of her childhood an agnostic, if not an atheist, and  had expressed strong feelings against spiritualism. He had insisted on  selling a lovely summer retreat that Sophia's family had owned, simply  because of its proximity to a spiritualist centre called Lily Dell. It is true  that Erma had managed to espouse Theosophy in spite of her father,  but she had been driven away from home by his disapproval. 
    Raja on the other hand, had been surrounded since birth by the devout  Hinduism of his mother and the Theosophica! ideals of his father. Until  this point he had no reason to question the utterances of the Theosophical 
    77  
 
                   
 
    leaders. Now there were serious differences among these leaders, but  none of this would shake his deep inner faith in a destiny somehow  purposefully guided by the Masters. Nor would he ever lose sight of  what he personally owed to Leadbeater and Mrs Besant. This was an  important distinction between Raja and Krishna. 
    While Krishna was deeply distressed and unhappy about the events  at Huizen and the pronouncements at the Ommen Camp, he was afraid  that if he were to openly speak against all these things in which he  disbelieved totally, they would say he had failed and was taken over  by the dark forces. He claimed to have tried several times to speak to  Mrs Besant, but she did not take it all in. There is a different version,  however, of the way in which Krishna dealt with this problem. 
    Krishna rejected all the revelations about Initiations and Apostles,  the World Religion and World University and such things, but was  unwilling to tell Mrs Besant himself. But he was determined that she  must be told. He sent Professor Marcault, an official of the World  University, to break the news whilst he, Krishna, remained in the car  outside Mrs Beasant's London residence. Marcault told Mrs Besant  as simply as he could and departed, leaving her deathly pale and  severely shocked. For some time afterwards she was physically ill,  and thereafter showed signs of rapid aging, loss of memory and a  tendency to focus on the past. She was torn between a series of  opposed loyalties and demands and remained in a state of uncertainty  and conflict for the rest of her life.2 
    On 3 November 1925 Mrs Besant, with her entourage, boarded ship  for India. Rosalind was sharing a cabin with Lady Emily and Krishna  with Shiva Rao. They stopped briefly in Rome, where they were joined  by George Arundale and Rukmini. Now it was Krishna's turn to be  reprimanded by the Mahachohan Ал through George as intermediary.  Krishna was reproved for his scepticism, and warned that he could  ruin his chances. 
    This voyage was certainly not destined to be easy. Rosalind, Krishna  and the Arundales spent a good deal of time on deck playing bridge. One  can imagine that the atmosphere around the bridge table must have been  tense, with Rosalind pining for Nitya, the increasing hostility between  Krishna and George, and George's irritation with Rukmini, whose eyes  sometimes followed her old childhood friend, Raja, as he paced around  the deck. 
    Just one day after sailing from Naples they received a telegram saying 
    78  
 
                   
 
  A Left Turn 
    that Nitya had the flu. Five days later at Port Said they received a  telegram from Nitya saying his flu was more serious and asking for  their prayers. 
    In spite of the scepticism that Krishna had recently exhibited, he still  believed that the Masters would not have let him leave Ojai if Nitya  were going to die. That night George suggested they all go to bed and  try to get in touch with the Masters about Nitya. The next morning  he reported that Nitya was destined to go on to great things, both  in Krishna's future and in India's. All felt he would be well, except  Rosalind, who told only Lady Emily about her experience. It was quite  different from everyone else's. She saw Nitya with a white silk scarf  around his neck and she knew he was dying. He seemed in good spirits  and happy to talk to her. He told her many things and said she must  remember this conversation. She said she was a ?(r)doubting Thomas' and  how could she be sure when she woke up that it was not just a dream?  She remembers his eyes looking around the room and then fixing on  the scarf around his throat. 
    ?(r)Remember this scarf,?А└ he told her. 
    She asked him why he had the scarf around his neck and he said  his throat was very sore. She was puzzled by it because she did not  recognize it as an article of his clothing, each piece of which she knew  well as she had so often done his packing. 
    Lady Emily asked her not to tell Krishna what she had seen as it  would upset him. That same morning a telegram came informing them  of Nitya's death. It had been sent during the night but had been held up  by a violent thunderstorm as they were entering the Suez Canal. Later,  when Mme de Manziarly arrived in Adyar with Nitya's ashes, Rosalind  asked her about the scarf and she said it was her scarf which she had put  around Nitya's throat because it was sore. While so many around her  were-claiming to have the most incredible occult experiences, Rosalind  never made much of that one very real and poignant final moment with  Nitya. With a resilience that she would display throughout her life,  she kept her grief deep within her. By the time they reached Adyar,  Krishna too seemed outwardly recovered from signs of grief, at least  in public. Yet Nitya's death meant more to him than the loss of his  brother. It meant also that he had allowed himself to be swayed by  false illusions. He had evidently believed until that moment that the  Masters would protect and guide him. Now he felt not only betrayed  but doubtful of the Masters' very existence. It was the beginning of his  overt break with Theosophy. 
    At Adyar Rosalind stayed with Lady Emily and a large group of 
    79      young girls, while Raja and Krishna moved into their old rooms at  the headquarters building. 
    As Rosalind was still suffering from the urticaria that had plagued  her in Ojai, and was reluctant to be seen, she felt touched by the great  care and kindness Krishna showed in keeping her near him during the  day and letting her rest in his spacious apartment, tenderly treating  her affliction. Rosalind assumed, quite naturally, that this was for her  sake, but one day Helen Knothe came and hugged her and said how  important it was for Krishna to be with her because of her closeness to  Nitya. Helen, because of Krishna's previous attachment to her, might  well have anticipated that he would now turn solely to her for comfort;  her words to Rosalind show her lack of pettiness. Yet, as we shall see,  he did not exclude Helen either. Krishna said that he and Nitya were  now one in body and spirit, which might explain his need to be close to  the person Nitya had so deeply loved. But just as valid an explanation  could be that Nitya was no longer between him and Rosalind. Krishna  had not, after all, hesitated in his insistence on taking Rosalind to India  and denying his critically ill brother the solace of her care. 
    But while Krishna had drawn closer to Rosalind, Rosalind had drawn  closer to Raja. One evening to get the cool air, she and Raja had gone  up the outside staircase of the headquarters and were sitting on the flat  roof, momentarily setting aside the strain and unhappiness of the past  months, talking and laughing and enjoying the lovely view which swept  over the compound and across the river. Suddenly Krishna appeared  and, directing his annoyance entirely at Raja, asked just what they were  doing up there. They had not remembered that they were right over  his room, but Raja had the distinct feeling he was being reprimanded  for enjoying these few moments alone with Rosalind. Many years later  Helen would recall that she and Krishna were together in his room  when they heard Rosalind and Raja on the roof and that Krishna  was shocked that they could laugh and joke so soon after Nitya's  death.3 
    Meanwhile Leadbeater expressed his frank disapproval of the hap- penings in Holland. He did not believe anyone had so rapidly passed  initiations which he and Mrs Besant only hoped to do in their next life.  That any of them should have passed the fifth initiation and be on the  same plane as the Masters was totally unacceptable. Even as the vehicle,  Krishna was not expected to attain that height and his vehicleship was  still in question as far as Leadbeater was concerned. This did not deter  Leadbeater from relaying his own version of initiations and the faction  led by George began to hint that Leadbeater's powers were failing him 
    80  
 
                   
A Left Turn 
    or, worse, that the ?(r)blacks' had got him. The unpleasant implication  would soon be applied to Krishna as well. 
    These conflicts within the inner circle did not dim an undercurrent  of great excitement and expectation in the less advanced, among whom  word had spread that the Lord would manifest himselfin Krishna during  the Jubilee. When scores of people all expect the same happening, which  they had all read about, heard about, and dreamed of for more than a  decade, it is not entirely surprising that they should indeed all see it  come to pass Ал at least most of them. 
    On 29 December 1925 in his talk to members under the great banyan  tree, Krishna suddenly changed his use of personal pronoun from the  third to the first. Those like the Arundales, who had reservations about  the vehicle's readiness, claim to have noticed nothing out of the ordinary  and merely thought he was quoting scripture when he said: ?(r)He comes to  lead us,?А└ and then switched to: ?(r)I come not to destroy but to build.' 
    Rosalind, who had been with Krishna while he dressed and prepared  with unusual care for this talk, had been somewhat surprised when he  suddenly said, ?АсYou watch! I''m going to show them something.?А└ And  she did notice the extraordinary magnetic power he scemed to cast over  his audience. 
    This was a critical moment in Krishna's life, for Mrs Besant took the  change of person and, as some noticed, the change of voice as evidence  that the coming had begun. 
    Leadbeater, at this time, was giving Krishna his full support, saying  there was no doubt that He had used the vehicle and would continue  to use it, but only intermittently, in other words on appropriate occasions,  not when the vehicle was eating or taking trains. 
    For the moment, Krishna accepted this position and did not push for  more, although the time would come very soon when being a mere  vehicle was not nearly enough. 
    Meanwhile Rosalind was travelling through India with Lady Emily  and her daughters and staying in luxurious homes like that of Lady  Emily's brother, Lord Lytton, Governor of Bengal. A few months  later she travelled with Mrs Besant in a very different style, staying  with Indians and really getting to know the people and the country.  With Raja, she visited the small village near Madanapalle, Krishna's  birthplace, where as a boy of sixteen Raja had started the school of  adult education in conjunction with the college near by. All the villagers  came out with garlands to greet them. She met many Indians with  whom she would be lifelong friends and she also met Raja's mother, 
    81      although neither of them guessed at that time what their relationship  was to be. 
    Raja was now asked by Mrs Besant to take over all the work of the  Star which Nitya had been expected to do had he lived. In reality Nitya  would probably not have had the strength to shoulder the burden of  what the Star was to become. No one then foresaw that Krishna would  sever his relationship with the Theosophical Society and need his own  independent organization to fund and make possible his continual travels  for worldwide talks and meetings. Raja had displayed an early talent for  this work, which Leadbeater had seen when he first chose the young  Raja to be one of his special pupils, and of which Mrs Besant had been  well aware for many years. She clearly reaffirmed her faith in Raja's  abilities the following year when she addressed a meeting of the Star  Council, at Eerde Castle in Ommen. 
    It is I think, a very fortunate thing for this Organisation, that you have 
    not only my son Krishnaji, but one whom I have known from quite 
    his youth, Rajagopal, who adds to a very brilliant literary ability, I 
    am glad to find, very considerable business faculty, a quality essential 
    in work of this kind. 
    I believe you have two very fine officers to help you on each side 
    of the work, and I know you will always have the blessing of the 
    Great Teachers of the world.4 
    Much later Krishna would disregard these words, which were the  very core of Raja's motive for taking on what would be his life work  and for his devotion to it. Krishna would inaccurately claim that he  had asked Raja to help him. 
    By May all of India is shrouded in insufferable heat and Rosalind, still  suffering from a recurrence of urticaria, was relieved to board ship  for England. Mrs Besant had been given a stateroom with private  bath which she asked Rosalind to share with her. She would awaken  Rosalind early every morning after first drawing her a bath and then  urge her out so she could work in privacy on her manuscript, India:  Bond or Free? Rosalind kept her face covered with a scarf to hide the  blemishes made by urticaria, which led to a rumour among the European  passengers that those dark young men had some nefarious hold over her.  To avoid further gossip she had to show her face and declare that she  was a free and willing passenger in the company of Mrs Besant. 
    82  
 
                   
A Left Turn 
    On their arrival in England, Mrs Besant wanted Rosalind to prepare  to go to Cambridge to take a degree in political science. Rosalind was  somewhat dismayed at the idea, but agreed to study French and prepare  for the other necessary entrance requirements. She was staying with  Miss Dodge, who took an immediate liking to her and arranged for  her to be tutored by Miss Ellison, the headmistress ofa girls' school. 
    One day Miss Ellison invited Rosalind to bring Raja for tea and told  Rosalind afterwards that she would get quite as good an education  by marrying him and giving up Cambridge. One can hope that they  were both discreet enough at the time not to pass on this comment to  Miss Dodge or Mrs Besant, although the day would come when the  latter would welcome their engagement for other reasons. In any case,  Rosalind was not ready for such a commitment, fond though she was  of Raja. 
    When he returned to England that May, Raja had to face the task  of organizing the Star Camp in Ommen. Although the primitive  arrangements of the previous year were to be much improved, all  camp members were now asked to do a share of the work, cleaning  their own rooms and washing up dishes. Being accountable for the  running of a large camp naturally subjected Raja to criticism from  some camp members who were not accustomed to doing their own  work or taking such orders. They compared Raja's efficacious manner  with the gentle and undemanding Krishna. 
    This was the beginning of a lifelong role for Raja: he would be the  whipping boy for any dissatisfaction that centred on Krishna's activities.  [t was not conceivable to most people that Krishna could be anything less  than perfect; yet someone had to be blamed for the muddles that quite  often occurred because of his actions. A few years later an enthusiastic  follower told Krishna he would like to give money for a golf course at  Ommen apd Krishna said, *?АсWhat a good idea! Go and talk to Rajagopal.'  It might have occurred to Krishna that he himself should have consulted  Raja before giving any opinion to the eager donor. Raja greeted the idea  with a forthright lack of enthusiasm, wondering what possible purpose a  golf course could have for a few weeks of camp. The problems it would  create were obvious, but the man went off saying that Raja was a most  unpleasant fellow.> 
    Meanwhile Mrs Besant, disturbed by the dissensions within the soci- ety, wrote to Leadbeater from London on 17 June 1926 a compellingly  frank and decisive statement of her moral and spiritual position in the  face of the innuendo and gossip that had prevailed at Adyar. 
    She reaffirmed the tie between herself and Leadbeater, precluding any 
    33  
 
                   
 
   
    misunderstanding. Evidently she had not been aware of the extent of  gossip at Adyar during the Jubilee which she now held responsible  for preventing what should have happened, namely the ?(r)coming'.  Jinarajadasa had written to her that Krishna did not believe her words  at Ommen concerning the ?(r)coming'. Mrs Besant had first confronted  Krishna after their arrival in London and he had explained his confusion  over Leadbeater's evident disbelief and the differences he perceived  between his two protectors. Above all, Krishna had been distressed  by the gossip and assigning of labels. Avoiding labels would be a  central theme in his talks as would a distrust of experiences Ал meaning 
    occult ones. 
    Mrs Besant, however, remained steadfast in her own convictions that  her words had come directly from the King (of the Occult Hierarchy)  and that therefore there were only three possibilities if this were doubted:  first, that she was lying; second, that she was deluded; and, third, that  she was as sure of her directions as ever. If she was wrong about this,  everything she had received would come under question. She would  have misled many people who had trusted her and would feel compelled  to retire from public life. She totally rejected this last possibility, saying  that she would continue to follow any directions she might receive, but  that all this did not affect her relationship with Krishna, and she did  not mind being doubted. She had told Krishna that it might be best  if she did not go to Ommen that year, but he insisted that she must.  She replied that then he must risk what she might say. 
    Without reproach she commented that she had tried to speak of these  matters with Leadbeater at Adyar but he had always been too busy with  his books. While she had usually deferred to him on occult matters and  admitted his superiority in that domain, she did not doubt her own  experience when it came directly from the great ones. If Leadbeater  had not always been able to confirm this, it was perhaps that some  directions had not come his way. She urged him to recognize that  this was an exceptional time when courage was more important than  caution, and she reaffirmed her faith in the ?(r)coming'. None of them  should stand in the way of that great work. She begged him once  more not to allow factions to divide and confuse the young. 
    The letter was a striking revelation of Mrs Besant's courage, integrity 
    and loyalty; and, above all, of her capacity for deep and abiding love. 
    These qualities would not be diminished, even by the baffling shocks 
    she would soon receive from Krishna. 
    When the 1926 Ommen Camp started on 23 July, it was ready to 
    accommodate over two thousand people from all over the world. Almost 
    84  
 
                   
A Left Turn 
    everyone moved into the tented grounds in the pine woods a mile away  from the castle. Krishna, Raja and Rosalind stayed in Eerde Castle.  Krishna was having occasional very mild recurrences of the ?(r)process',  which he now wanted Rosalind to mother him through. As before in  Ojai, he clung to her like a small child and with characteristic naivetАД| she  failed to find in his touch anything beyond the need to be mothered. 
    The fire-lighting ceremony to the God Agni was performed by  Krishna and Mrs Besant when she arrived just in time for the camp  opening. Krishna gave, as yet, no sign of the iconoclasm that was to  come. But this camp and the gathering preceding it at Eerde Castle in  early July saw a basic change in Krishna's message. There was no more  reference to ?(r)the Path of Discipleship'. Instead he urged that each find his  own path and law and listen to his own voice. In a series of talks, given  to a few invited persons before the large camp opened, he spoke of the  kingdom of happiness which is to be found within each individual. 
    Most of the crowd had no inkling where this new turn would lead.  Some felt the difference, although they still saw it as a fulfilment of the  prophecy that the Lord had indeed really come. 
    At the opening camp-fire talk, attended by two thousand people,  many were certain that the Lord Maitreya was speaking through  Krishna. Others were less sure. James Wedgwood (a Liberal Catholic  Bishop and close friend of Leadbeater) whispered in Mrs Besant's ear  words so alarming to her that she asked Raja to drive her and Krishna  back to the castle the moment the meeting broke up. Raja, some years  later, wrote an account of that 
    extraordinary evening when A.B. told Krishnaji in his room at the  Castle that it was a great black magician whom she knew well who  had spoken through him. Of course I knew, though it was A.B. who  said this to Krishnaji, it was really Wedgwood who claimed he saw it.  I remember well his whispering something to Amma towards the end  of the talk. Wedgwood was sitting next to her and I was sitting next  to Wedgwood. As soon as the talk was over she had me bring the  car; and quickly ushering Krishnaji into it, she and I drove straight to  the Castle with him. She then came to Krishnaji's room. 1 was with  him then and I went out because I saw she wanted to speak to him. I  was waiting outside when, in just a few minutes, she came out, and  she put her hands on my shoulders and said, ?(r)My dear, everything  will be all right, do not worry.?А└ I was puzzled and thought that she  meant that Krishnaji had been somewhat physically shaken, for he  certainly was in a daze. [ then said goodnight to her and went back 
    85      to Krishnaji, who was sitting on his bed looking much amazed. He  then told me what Amma had told him about the powerful black  magician. Krishnaji said that he had told Amma that if she really  believed that, he should not talk anymore at all, at which she was  very disturbed and distressed.. 
    Wedgwood would raise the black magician whenever he found  Krishna's words heretical, but Mrs Besant never again suggested  that he was in the hands of the dark forces. Nevertheless, for her,  the question of Krishna's consciousness was far from resolved.
