12 The Pathless Land 无路之国
    In spring 1929, Raja was again preparing for the May Camp in the  QOak Grove when Krishna returned to Ojai exhausted. The talks  were postponed. Krishna went with Rosalind and the Ingelmans to  recuperate at Idylwild in the southern California mountains. Here,  without preamble of the ?(r)process' he turned to Rosalind for comfort  from his exhaustion. In the mountains that he loved and under her  care the pain in his head and his bronchitis were alleviated. Krishna, at  thirty-four, could still arouse in a woman a mothering instinct usually  reserved for a young child. When he sometimes came into her bed,  Rosalind held him like a small sick boy, later innocently relating these  occurrences to Raja, who accepted her words at face value. It would  not have occurred to either of them or to anyone else in their circle to  do otherwise. 
    Although he had cancelled most of his lectures that spring, Krishna  still had the energy to discuss reorganization. Raja had come to feel that  Krishna's new direction made the Order of the Star inappropriate and  that a much simpler organization should be established instead. They  spent hours each day talking over plans that would change everything,  the Star publications, the nature of the camps. 
    By the time the Ommen Camp opened in August Krishna had moved  inexorably toward the dissolution of the Order of the Star. He could now  rest assured that Raja was firmly by his side to build the organization he  would need for the future. He was hardly stepping off the cliff. The  Order of the Star would be replaced by the Star Publishing Trust. 
    Now that Phillip van Pallandt was married and expecting a child,  the Dutch Government wanted him to reclaim Eerde Castle for his  heirs, as it was a historical estate. The following year Raja would have  the complicated task of returning title and sorting out the financial  entanglements that resulted from this exchange as many improvements  had been made by the Order of the Star. The pine forest land with the  rustic but quite comfortable huts was retained for the Camp. 
    Krishna could now retire from all his earthly responsibilities, continue

    to refuse ownership of property, and withdraw from all his trusts. He  had found one man in whom he could have total confidence, to publish  his talks, to raise money, to run the Camps in Ommen and Qjai, to  travel with him and to ensure his unhampered freedom. If there would  always be a discrepancy between his actual situations and the image he  put forth, it did not appear to concern him. Yet his frequent references to  himself as a beggar, without personal belongings or wealth, were much  too literally expressed to be taken metaphorically. Krishna owned a series  of expensive cars, the most fashionable clothes, and always had several  houses at his disposal, not only figuratively but legally, whether held in  title in his name or in trust for him is surely irrelevant. He would never  publicly admit that he needed clothes, automobiles, travel funds, places  to live, to talk and to rest. To acquire the money for ali these things  would be Raja's concern, leaving Krishna free to make his declaration  of independence. That summer of 1929 at the opening talk of the  Ommen Camp Krishna announced the dissolution of the Order of  the Star and declared that ?(r)truth is a pathless land', that henceforth  he wanted no followers, and that his only concern was to set men  free from the bondage of all religions, beliefs and fears, as he had set  himself free. 
    ?(r)All conquering and all knowing am I, detached, untainted, untram- melled, wholly freed by destruction of desire. Whom shall I call Teacher?  Myself found the way.?± Those lines, rooted in Krishna's mind nine years  before, came to fruition in this talk. 
    Yet Krishna was still speaking to a predominantly Theosophical  audience, present there by invitation. There were many who found his  words confusing ⌒ even alarming. They had been waiting for eighteen  years for the world teacher to appear and now Krishna had told them  to ?(r)wait for someone else', he had nothing to do with it. It is unlikely  that anyone was sufficiently intrepid to add up the time, energy, money  and hope?(r)that had been riding on him for all those years, now dashed  in one very eloquent hour. 
    Whatever confusion and heartache his words had inflicted on Mrs  Besant, she once again revealed her own greatness of spirit as she  publicly supported Krishna by stating: 
    the very absence of an organisation might appeal to the more intel- ligent people who think out their own ?(r)Great Truth' . . . My  fundamental belief in Krishnamurti as the World Teacher makes me  more inclined to observe and study rather than express an opinion  on one whom I consider far my superior.' 
    105      Privately she would remain confused about him for the rest of her  life. Publicly her motherly love for him appeared to suppeort her faith  that he would ultimately fulfil the role for which he had been chosen  and nurtured for the past twenty years. 
    Krishna and Raja both attended Mrs Besant's eighty-second blrthday  celebration in London on 1 October. This occasion united her not only  with her children but also brought together amicably, for that one  evening at least, the factions in her ?(r)spiritual' family. Her birthday  message to the world reflected her continuing hope for world and  individual harmony. 
    If every one of us will work, strenuously and continuously, until  each has purged his heart of every trace of resentment against every  person, who has, he thinks, injured him, we shall then find, perhaps  to our surprise, that Peace is reigning over the whole world.2 
    Krishna continued with his own theme, not peace but liberation;  liberation of human beings from the fetters of their own beliefs and fears,  and liberation for him from the role set upon him by the Theosophical  Society. 
    Three years earlier, in 1926, Mrs Besant had encouraged Krishna's  flowering interest in education by making him the President of the Theo- sophical Educational Trust. The TET had come into existence as part of  Mrs Besant's plan to free the entire Indian educational system from its  domination by the British, who were trying to denationalize all Indians.  For this purpose, under various trusts, Mrs Besant raised money, bought  land and started many schools and colleges throughout India. Long  before Krishna's presidency of it, the Arundales also had travelled all  over India to raise money for the National High School in Adyar under  the TET. This school, run by Theosophists, had flourished. 
    When Krishna decided to resign from all organizations in 1930, he  resigned also from the TET. This dealt a serious blow to all the schools  under the trust. His followers, who had been helping, also lost interest  and the trust could no longer function. He wanted to sell the school  land in Adyar for which Mrs Besant and the Arundales had raised  money, and transfer the school to a tract of land near Madanapalle  which one of his followers had found for him. This school was then  renamed Rishi Valley. Much the same procedure was followed with  the school in Benares, later called Rajghat. Eventually a Bengali lawyer  discovered that the transfer of the trust to Krishna's ownership had not  been legally enacted. Thus the TET was still alive and could be revived  by interested Theosophists like George Arundale, by then President of 
    106  
 
                   
The Pathless Land 
    the society.? It is not difficult to imagine the ill-feelings that must have  arisen during all these transfers and negotiations. 
    If to some people Mrs Besant appeared confused in her statements  about Krishna, Leadbeater viewed her in a different light, as seeing more  eye to eye with him regarding Krishna's role as the vehicle. Leadbeater  pointed out to George Arundale that Mrs Besant was careful in her  statements at the school to make clear that the manifestation was only  partial, that Krishna was only the vehicle of the world teacher and that  members should not be limited to studying only Krishna's writings,  although she did request that they be included in their programme.  Leadbeater went on to say that Mrs Besant did not approve of Krishna's  intolerant and exaggerated statements any more than he, Leadbeater,  or Arundale did, but neither would she obstruct him, feeling that they  each had their own work and should not interfere with one another.  According to Leadbeater Mrs Besant allowed that Krishna should show  a certain fanaticism in order to make a strong impact on his public. 
    However, Krishna was no longer concerned with Leadbeater's opin- ion. He wrote to Mrs Besant in February 1930 reiterating his confidence  in his own direction despite the opposition of Leadbeater or a million  others. 
    The protectorship was over. It was not made an open issue, but there  was now a definite estrangement between Leadbeater and Krishna,  one which would never heal. Ultimately Krishna would express the  opinion that Leadbeater was evil.# His teachings were now undercutting  Leadbeater and many of the other Theosophical leaders. Their effort to  maintain their positions by explaining that the coming had gone wrong  and that Krishna no longer belonged in the society was, in his eyes, an  open declaration of war. Leadbeater was to become more and more  assertive that the coming had gone wrong, and even go so far as to sug- gest that if it hadn't been for Mrs Besant's certainty, no one would have  paid much'attention to Krishna at all. Although he had been the one to  discover the young Krishna, he had very soon become open to the possi- bility that he had made a mistake. Now he appeared to be convinced. 
    When, in 1930, Krishna resigned from the Theosophical Society, Raja  did not follow him in this formal step and was to retain most of his close  friendships within the society in spite of Krishna's increasing antago- nism. Later this would become a sore point between Krishna and Raja. 
    Raja's and Rosalind's lives were so full of people, travel, idealism and  work that it would have been a wonder if they ever had time to stop  and take stock of their own relationship. They were separated for long 
    107  
 
                   
 
    intervals and even when they were together they were seldom alone.  One or the other of them was usually with Krishna, for it had long  since been recognized that he should not be left on his own and they  were always conscious of their promise to Nitya. Yet there was the  inevitable strain of having too many people around, those who invited  themselves and those whom Krishna inadvertently invited ⌒ then wished 
    he hadn't.  Rosalind's interest in fashion design did not wane. This talent served  her well in making her own clothes and sometimes a sweater or shirt 
    for Raja. In the summer of 1930, following an invitation from Mme  Barrero, whom she had first met in Cuba, she went to Paris to attend  the fashion openings. It was typical of Raja that he never put down  another's interest, no matter how removed it might be from his own.  Throughout their life Rosalind would follow many pursuits, each with  great eagerncss; he always encouraged these ventures. 
    Krishna was also in France at this time, where his difficulties with the  Theosophists did not seem to interfere with his success. On 23 October  1930 Rosalind wrote to her mother, Sophia from Paris. 
    Evidently Krishnaji gave a marvelous lecture in Strasbourg and the  papers gave good reviews. They said that except for Maurice Cheva- lier, Krishnamurti was the only one who could attract thousands. He  read his lecture in French . . . 
    Along with the teas and receptions that they all attended in Paris, as  well as art exhibitions, and lovely weekends in the country house of  Mme de Manziarly at La Tours, Rosalind was aware of the Depression.  ?(r)We hear on all sides how everyone is financially hard hit in last  week's stock exchange. Conditions are bad all over the world. I expect  California is better off than anyplace.' 
    Rosalind had a more personal worry that month in Paris. She found  that she was pregnant. Rather than feeling delighted as she normally  should have, for she and Raja had been hoping for some years to have  a child, she was in despair. Krishna had recently been reiterating his  old view that none of those close to him should have children but  must keep themselves free and pure for ?(r)the Work'. That she was  driven to consider having an abortion in Switzerland must be taken as  an indication not only of her despair, but also of her initial willingness  to be guided by Krishna's attitude; and one might wonder why she felt  she could not discuss her predicament with the person who should be  most concerned ⌒ her husband. She might have guessed that Raja would 
    108  
 
                   
 
  The Pathless Land 
    be totally opposed to such a course. Fortunately for me, whose future  was at stake, Rosalind on her own suddenly felt an abortion was all  wrong, no matter what Krishna would say, and decided to keep her  baby. However, she had gone through a considerable amount of stress  over the whole situation and on this she would blame a very difficult  pregnancy. 
    On first hearing her news, Krishna displayed the same displeasure  that he had shown when she married Raja. It was a reaction Krishna  showed to anyone close to him who tried to pursue a life apart from  efforts on his behalf. More than one person of talent was driven to  abandon a promising career ⌒ fortunately not all succumbed. In this  case, another reason may have been an emotional reaction he had at  the thought of them having a child. When Nitya died Krishna had  assumed that Rosalind would then be closest to him. Her marriage to  Raja had probably been a shock that he had to endure in isolation. For  them to have a baby was at the very least a further affront. 
    The serene Sicilian town of Taormina, perched above pine-fringed  coves of pellucid water, under the volcanic shadow of Mount Etna,  was still a very special place to Krishna. Here he and Nitya had been  sequestered in 1913 during the guardianship trial between their father  and Mrs Besant. Here he claimed to have seen the Lord Buddha.  Taormina exudes romance and mystery, from its streets bordered with  small shops of unaffected charm, to its ancient Greek amphitheatre and  the ever-present Mount Etna, sometimes clad in snow and sometimes  in sulphurous fumes, its spluttering flames licking a night sky. 
    Krishna, Raja and Rosalind came there in late autumn, out of season,  with few tourists ⌒ leaving them in happy solitude. In this setting  whatever resentment Krishna may have felt about Rosalind's pregnancy  dropped away. 
    It was he who helped her tenderly through the first months of  discomfort. He believed himself to have healing gifts and, whether  or not this was true, he certainly never shirked the attempt to bring  comfort to the ill. Raja on the other hand was of a squeamish nature,  fainted easily at the sight of blood, and having a low threshold of pain  himself, identified too readily with another's affliction. But those six  weeks were a rare period of closencss and sanctuary between the three  of them. 
    In December Rosalind went back to Ommen while Raja accompanied  Krishna to Greece. Krishna was bowled over by the Parthenon. Although 
    109      it was unusual for him to become so ecstatic over man-made beauty, he  used to tell me how he had fallen to his knees and kissed the soil when  he first saw it. He found Greece altogether a stimulating experience and  his talks, if the size of the crowds are a measure, were an overwhelming  success. He said later that he was even told that if he stayed they  would make him the mayor of Athens. Krishna had a tendency to  invest such comments with more significance than was intended and  they sometimes went to his head. The loving, mystical nature that had  been his at Taormina took a quicksilver turn in Athens. He and Raja had  been put up in the Grande Bretagne hotel, and it was here that they  had their first major confrontation. While the memory of what led to it  has dimmed, the scene that followed was never erased from Raja's mind.  Krishna had gone back upon confirmed arrangements which put Raja in  a very bad position with their hosts in Athens. Raja was so exasperated  at once again bearing the brunt of antagonism that rightfully ought not  to have been directed at him, that he said to Krishna, ?°You ought to be  exposed.' 
    Whereupon Krishna had laughed and replied, ?(r)Go ahead, try it, who  would ever believe you against me?'  Of course he was perfectly right, as many similar incidents throughout  the years would corroborate. 
    It is difficult for those of us not inculcated with the concepts of karma,  dharma and reincarnation, to understand exactly what motivated Raja  to give his life so unstintingly to the work around Krishna, as well  as to the man himself. He had agreed to take on a task and with his  sense of perfection he would let nothing distract him from giving it his  total concentration. That the task would have difficulties beyond his  imagining was beside the point. He did not doubt that Rosalind was  firmly at his side in spirit and that they were bound to this common  purpose. Even so, throughout the next thirty years there would be  occasions when he felt he could take no more and would offer to  leave. But Krishna would prevail upon him to stay and would go to  any length of apology, written and verbal, to make things right again.  Of course there was no real right, nor could there be. And the scenes  and despair would become more and more intense over the years. 
    Both Raja and Rosalind wanted their child to be born in America,  and they were planning to sail back together in good time. This was to  be one of the rare occasions when Raja, perhaps still smarting from the  episode in Athens, had allowed himself to leave Krishna, who had taken  a brief side trip to Romania, where he had been invited by the Queen.  Just before sailing for America, Raja received a cable that Krishna had 
    110  
 
                   
The Pathless Land 
    been poisoned. The Queen, suspecting a plot, had him taken off the  train before the scheduled stop, but even so he suddenly fell deathly ill.  (Many years later, in 1946, the doctor who had treated him in Romania  showed up in Ojai during another serious illness and confirmed this  story.) 
    That night in Ommen Raja, sometimes in tears, paced the floor until  dawn, torn between his two responsibilities ⌒ to go to Krishna, who  might be dying, or to accompany his wife, still in a frail condition, to  America. He went to Romania and was not to see my mother or me  until I was six weeks old. 
    Rosalind, once back in America, was in the loving circle of her family.  She was also surrounded by dear friends, with one of whom, Beatrice  Wood, she had agreed to start a clothes designing business. Now she  had to tell Beatrice that there would be a slight postponement of their  plans. 
    ?(r)Don't worry,' she said, ?(r)as soon as the baby's born I'll give it to my  mother to take care of and we'll carry right on.' 
    Beatrice's scepticism about this solution turned out to be justified, for  when Rosalind saw her baby she told Beatrice she could not possibly  hand me over to her mother.> This was perhaps just as well for Beatrice,  who then added ceramics to her other artistic talents and in this medium  later became a world-famous artist. 
    Raja had sent Rosalind a list of Indian names that he liked and Rosalind  chose the name Radha for me. From that time Raja would leave most  decisions concerning my upbringing to my mother, while standing in  the wings to be sure all was well. He told Rosalind that he would  intervene only if he felt something was going wrong. 
    In July, after a very difficult childbirth, Rosalind's recovery was  complicated by a bad sore on her back which, aggravated by the  nurses' carelessness in the hospital, became infected and had to be  removed immediately. It was found to be malignant and the doctor  told her that this was the most serious form of skin cancer and that  she would only live from two to ten years. She never told anyone this  news (until she told me forty years later). But for the next few years  she did not doubt the doctor, who had also advised her not to have any  more children as another childbirth would be even more difficult than  her first. 
    Raja returned to Ojai in September. He arrived at Arya Vihara late 
    at night and Rosalind excitedly hurried him in to see his new baby. She 
    concealed her disappointment when she saw that he was far more excited 
    to tell her about the world's economic situation and America going off 
    111      the gold standard. She did not then appreciate that Raja would continue  to turn to great financial advantage his observations while travelling.  He seemed to have a sixth sense about investments. In 1929 he had  warned his friend Louis Zalk to sell out of the stock market. Louis  had the greatest respect for Raja's karmic past as well as his present  capabilities, but had wondered what a young Hindu could tell him,  a successful American industrialist, about the stock market. His own  Theosophical background, however, persuaded Louis that he should not  totally ignore Raja. He sold half his holdings. When, a short time later,  that half was all he had left, he acquired a lifelong confidence in Raja's  financial acumen. 
    That night Rosalind paid no more attention to Raja's words than he  did to his baby, but when I suddenly opened my eyes and looked at  my father with a smile, he was quite overwhelmed. His next reaction,  which Rosalind remembers came at that moment or shortly after, was  much more difficult for her to understand. Raja remarked that now they  had their baby there was no more reason for them to live as man and  wife. It may have been that he still retained an orthodox Theosophical  attitude toward marriage, that sex was only for having children, or it  may have been a poorly timed quip (of which he was capable) not  meant to be taken literally. Neither of them had a tendency to discuss  their private thoughts, being perhaps too surrounded by so many other  people's personal problems. In any event there was at this point a vast  gap in understanding between them, for Rosalind took that comment,  which Raja would forget having made, at face value and felt rejected as  a wife. Whatever the factors involved, a side of their marriage that had  never been too satisfactory was brought to an abruptend. The strong and  affectionate friendship between them would remain intact, but Rosalind  would feel more and more that her marriage was not complete. When  she later asked Raja for her freedom, he expressed a determination,  on principle, that they should not separate, partly because they had a  child, but mostly because he felt an obligation to Mrs Besant, who had  presided in person and in spirit over their wedding. 
    Rosalind thought she faced an early death and would have to leave  behind her young child, to whom she wanted to give as good a start  in life as possible. Yet she was still full of life and high spirits and the  eternal optimism of the young, who see death as a remote abstraction.  She wanted the most out of what life she might have left to her. When  Raja said they could maintain their independence within their marriage,  she took him at his word.
