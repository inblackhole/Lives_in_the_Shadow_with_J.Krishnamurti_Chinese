    Finding the Way 
    As Rosalind had originally suspected might happen, Raja did not  change at all. He gave little time to his marriage, then or in the  future, but he did stay with her in Ojai that winter, busily arrang- ing for the first Star camp to be held in May on the new land,  purchased the year before. Bath-houses and a cafeteria building were  being constructed, water lines, septic tanks and electricity laid in and 
    tenting sites cleared. A staff of workers had to be arranged for and  funds raised. For all this Raja was responsible. This was the begin- ning of his close and long friendship with the Logans and Louis  Zalk, all of whom were very helpful in the Star Camp organiza- tion. 
    Raja was also to form a close relationship with his mother-in-law  Sophia and his sister-in-law Erma, both of whom loved him. Sophia  had the same fastidious nature and habits as Raja. In some ways they  both understood his nature better than did Rosalind, and when it came  to food, they would cook what he liked rather than what he should  eat, unlike Rosalind. In her increasing interest in nutrition, Rosalind  would become more and more determined to eat what was healthy.  Nevertheless her frugal and practical nature served their lives well, for  not only was frugality necessary but something they both agreed was  morally important, as they assumed, perhaps incorrectly, that it was  important to Krishna. 
    Ojai in May is dry and balmy. The rainy season months are behind.  The fields not yet burned by summer heat are soft gold, contrasting  with the dark green leaves and ancient gnarled limbs of the oaks. Nestled  against a hill, a grove of these trees formed a natural amphitheatre. Below  the Oak Grove were the widely spaced bath-houses and the cafeteria  building, low whitewashed structures in a barren treeless field. Tents  were erected in the flat land. The daily camp schedule allowed time for  rest but not restlessness, for meditation but not boredom. There were  morning and afternoon lectures, plays, or music °– and a camp fire every  evening after dinner. Krishna did most of the lecturing, singing, and

    always lit the camp fire. An eyewitness at the first Ojai camp recorded  her impressions of that week. 
    The spirit of the camp was extremely delightful, even though the  whole 900 people arrived on Monday, and there was all the confusion  of getting people to their tents, getting workers to prepare the dinner  and serve it. Everyone fell right in line, all had their dinner without  any confusion and everyone arrived at the camp fire with promptness,  happiness and the wonderful feeling of having come home to a big  family reunion . . . We sat down on our blankets next to someone we  had never seen before, but we felt at one with them right away . . .  to me it was a very great miracle, the fact that 900 people gathered  there together all of one mind, one thought, one big family, radiantly  happy, all one in the great upliftment that prevailed all through camp  week. 
    During the meetings . . . Krishnaji . . . never sat in one place very  long . . . moving three or four times . . . We felt he did this because  when he stayed in one place several people would not pay attention to  the lecture at all . . . but would whisper among themselves about him 
    . always while listening to another lecturer he gave a great deal of  his attention to the chirping and singing birds in the trees . . . 
    At one of the meetings Mr Jinarajadasa was asked to give his ideas  as to the World Teacher in Theosophy. I don't think it was planned  that Krishnaji was to speak but he came to the back of the platform  as Mr Jinarajadasa finished and asked if he might say a word . . .  with a mischievous smile on his face and said, ?(r)I have been taking  notes,?°¿ at which they all laughed °– so did he. Then he went on to  say that Mr Jinarajadasa had said so and so and that was not the way  he wanted it understood, he said, ?(r)I am going to bring [him] on the  blanket when I get home.' 
    It is such a pleasure to see the love that vibrates between Krishnaji  and Mr Rajagopal -they are both such slight, slender, sweet boys;  so full of life, joy and happiness, and always speak to each other  with great love and understanding, it just fills one with happiness to  see them together. Of course Rajagopal is all attention to Krishnaji's  wishes but there is not the slightest touch of servitude. Rajagopal is  very handsome, a keen, bright eye, very boyish but you can tell by  his talk that he is very powerful. 
    One wonders if there were any at that camp who might have lifted  themselves long enough out of their euphoria to consider the humiliation 
    97  
 
                   
 
    that Krishna's words had inflicted on his old tutor Jinarajadasa. It is  evident that the controversy about Krishna's blending of consciousness  was still going on and that Krishna was now strong and clear about  who he was. But it was still an emotional issue, as can be seen from  the question and answer session on the second day of camp. 
    ?(r)You say you have no disciples, no followers; are you ungrateful  to the Theosophical Society for what they have done in organizing  and working for the sole purpose of furthering your coming?' This  distressed him [Krishna] greatly, it just seemed to wring the very  heart blood out of him. He simply answered, ?(r)Is the rose ungrateful  to the rose bush, is the branch ungrateful to the tree??°¿ When he closed  this meeting he said, ?(r)I hope I can be with you tonight, but I am so  tired and weary. Don't think I am making excuses, but this beating  up against the blank wall of prejudice and personalities is so very hard  and tiring . . . you ask one thing and do not listen to what I say. You  . . . put your own interpretation to my words without letting them  enter your inner self.'! 
    This would be a frequent complaint of Krishna's to his audiences for  the next half century. 
    At the end of May, Raja and Krishna went to Europe for the summer  Camp at Ommen. Rosalind stayed at home to allow her sister Erma to go  to Europe and to Ommen for the first time. They felt one of them should  be with Sophia, and Rosalind would also have to fill in for Erma with  Mary Gray. Raja would not be returning to Ojai until October. These  long separations were to become the pattern of their married life. 
    Judging from the letters Erma wrote home that summer to her mother  and Rosalind, this trip was a rare and exhilarating experience for her in  every way. It was Erma, with her interest in Theosophy, who had led  Rosalind on to her present path. Now Erma would meet and make  friends with the people in England and Holland who had already so  warmly befriended her younger sister. Busy as he was, Raja made an  effort to give Erma a good time in London before the Camp. 
    A few weeks later Erma wrote to Rosalind and Sophia from Eerde  Castle: 
    It is great fun to be at the tables and hear people from Poland or  Russia talk in their own language to each other and fluently change  to French or English. This is certainly a great attempt of international  understanding if nothing else.

    Tennis matches are on every afternoon and many play on the fine  courts. Others go bicycling and walking . . . Mr Mac Bean, etc all  think Raja very wonderful. He has accomplished tremendous things  here. Winifred told me last night that she has learned much working  this past week for him and that no one in the work can have the  faintest conception of what a careful administrator of money he is. 
    Fenn told me that one is forced to grow rapidly here, one sees a  great change in all . . . Eerde itself is wonderful and one feels in  complete touch with nature. I am sure one can travel quickly here  if it is within to do so. 
    Evidently Erma was not among those Theosophists or devotees  anxiously awaiting the world teacher; for Krishna's basic thrust that  summer, opening the way for the total dissolution of the Order of the  Star, seems not to have alarmed or confused her, although she remained  in most respects a devoted Theosophist for the rest of her life. 
    Eerde July 11  There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that we are enjoying the  greatest privilege in the world. 
    We meet in the meditation room at 11 o'clock. This morning  Krishnaji was answering questions. The wisdom he uses is beyond  anything I have ever experienced and he makes the goal of Truth so  real, so necessary to attain. When asked about the Order of the Star,  he says it is useful as a bridge to enter the Truth, but as quickly as  it ceases to be the bridge . . . we must break up the Order. That  we must develop beauty and purity and truth within, unfold the life  within, which so shines without that we become the bridge to that  life so others might come and cross. 
    I had a short walk with him yesterday and told him that I, too,  wanted to cross the *ream to the other shore he was talking about,  but how to find the way. He said, ?°„You will do it,?°¿ that strength and  will were necessary to break the fetters and advised me to go into the  woods after the meetings. Someway I can be freer with him and more  nearly myself than with anyone else. One thing he said this morning  was that the sap did not concern itself with whether it was to express  as leaves or flowers, but fulfils its own uniqueness. He said that hope  and truth were not the same and seemed to think that hope created a  barrier to truth. 
    The whole event I consider the greatest privilege of my life and  feel so grateful that I am experiencing it.

    Mr and Mrs. Leopold Stokowski, the Director of the Philadelphia  Philharmonic Orchestra came today. All these people have fascinating  histories and are splendid to know intimately. All are devoted to  Krishnaji and now there seems to be a blending and deeper under- standing among all. 
    Raja is very busy and I see very little of him. He works late  hours.  .. . I suppose the apricot season is just about finishing up and  things have been very busy at Ojai.  Much love to my darling mother,  ERMA 
    (Stokowski too must have heard about those apricots, for a year or  so later he called on Marvel, Erma's sister in Ojai, and asked if he could  come by for a piece of her famous apricot pie.) 
    Erma had the opportunity to make what would be lifelong friends  at Ommen. 
    Marvel will be interested to know that Mrs Hastings's grandfather  was Josiah Bailey who endowed Swarthmore College and her uncle  built Wharton Hall. She comes of an old Quaker family and knows  all Philadephia society. She said her grandfather had the best occult  library in America and because she was so interested in it when she  owned it, her husband burned it in the early days of married life.  Now he believes these things and they are very devoted . . . 
    She was amazed at her bill which she considers astonishingly  small, so she gave Raja $500 toward the tennis court and promises  him something every month; because she thinks him wonderful. (I  paid about $65 for the month.) 
    She says Philadelphia would be shocked to see Mr Stokowski going  shoeless into the meditation room. He played a lot of his trial records  for us the other night and they were wonderful . . . 
    Love to all from  ERMA 
    P.S. J. K.'s definition ofa cultured man is: ?(r)A cultured man is he  who is absolute ruler of himself, who is not dominated by passing  feelings, but who is dominated by intuition and who does not demand  anything from any individual.'  He says there is a creative faculty without form (with which Mr  Stokowski agrees) which is the ultimate stage but that the creative  faculty expressed in form is the beginning. ?(r)Life must take form to  function, but form is not all there is of life.'

    ... he says that truth or life cannot be stepped down or translated into  forms, creeds, beliefs or ceremonies, the minute that is attempted, it  ceases to be truth, that we should come to fulfilment through ourselves  and in the living of our lives becomes life itself and thus the bridge  which others seeing the example may cross to that truth. 
    . . . Krishnaji has been very well lately, playing volley ball etc.  Everyone is very enthusiastic about him and his talks. [ know I am  quite changed and would not have missed this summer's experience  for a great deal. 
    One can only hope that Krishna himself, by the end of the camp,  realized that there were many there who were willing and trying to  follow his message. He had felt in the early summer that people were  antagonistic to what he was saying, perhaps picking up from certain  Theosophists a bewilderment at his new direction. Reports from the  camp did not bring comfort to poor Mrs Besant, whose health continued  to decline, both mentally and physically. 
    Neither did the Theosophical rule of never gossiping always hold  fast. It was somewhat disconcerting to Raja to be told by several people  that they heard Rosalind was going to have a baby. Erma wrote home  inquiring: 
    Eerde August 2  Dearest Mother, 
    Raja came to me and asked if[ knew anything about the rumor that  Rosalind was to have a baby. He could not believe that she would not  have told him. I told him that several people had asked me and that |  cheerfully denied it, having believed Ros would have told us, if so.  But now Mrs C.]. [Jinarajadasa] tells Raja that Max Wardall told her  it was s& and was quite apparent. Of course I would be glad if it were  to be and so would Raja. But this is a funny way to find out such  news if it is true. 
    In haste,  ERMA 
    The rumour was not true. It would be three more years before I, their  only child, was born. But Raja had other concerns that summer. 
    Krishna was ever widening the gap between himself and the Theosophi- cal Society. There were many who could understand and sympathize  with him on this issue even if they could not understand what he 
    101      was saying. Some could extricate themselves from the emotional and  spiritual muddle that this alienation was creating and some were left  in total confusion. For, on one hand, Krishna was declaring that  there should be no authority; yet on the other he had insistently and  dramatically portrayed his own new condition as being united ?(r)with  the flame' and having the ?(r)vision of the mountain top', which seemed  to place him in a position of ultimate authority, nor did he specifically  deny that he was the world teacher. If he had been willing quite simply  to step aside or step down from the height on which Leadbeater and  Mrs Besant had placed him and stand as a mere human being on his  own philosophy, a great deal of present and future confusion could  have been avoided. But then, of course, he risked losing everything  the Theosophical Society and individual Theosophists had willingly  given him °– the Order of the Star, the castle, the land in Ommen,  Ojai and India, and most important, a sizeable international following.  He claimed he did not want followers which, perhaps, he did not equate  with the audiences who would fill his camps and lecture halls for years 
    to come. 
    To please him Mrs Besant had closed all the Esoteric Society chapters  throughout the world, stating that Krishna was the teacher and ought  to teach °– no one else. But this victory would be short lived. After  a short time Mrs Besant re-opened the ES. Her health was failing,  she was losing her memory and she was stranded in the midst of an  increasing conflict. 
    While Krishna had been struggling with the Theosophists, Raja had  been struggling with his personal perception of Krishna and the internal  frictions that had arisen around him within the society. Unlike Krishna,  who appeared to consider himself entitled to all that had been given  to him, Raja felt, and always would feel, a deep gratitude and duty  toward his benefactors, no matter what differences might arise. Just  as Nitya had been upset by Krishna's behaviour toward Mrs Besant  and Leadbeater, now Raja felt a similar distress. Some of the ideas that  were emanating from Krishna were indeed remarkable and Raja fully  recognized this. Yet, not having the mentality of a blind devotee, he was  able, sometimes to his discomfort, to see the often extreme bifurcation  in Krishna's private behaviour and his public message. Knowing that  Raja saw this did not endear him to Krishna; especially since, as the  years passed, Raja would be more outspoken with Krishna when these  instances occurred. But Krishna also seemed to recognize and rely upon  certain characteristics in Raja: enduring loyalty and commitment, and 
    102  
 
                   
Finding the Way 
    a capacity for love which once awakened was never withdrawn, no  matter how hurt he might be. 
    When Krishna returned to India with Mrs Besant after the 1928  Ommen Camp, Raja returned to America, where he was joined by  Rosalind on another lecture tour. 
    The tour included Cuba, where they met a fashion designer, Mme  Barrero, who was quite impressed with Rosalind's ability to design  clothes, especially sportswear, and suggested that there be an affiliation  between them. At that time Rosalind could not see how such a career  would fit into her life. 
    Raja had planned to give about thirty lectures in as many different  cities but after nineteen he called a halt and, without giving the true  reason, cancelled the rest of the tour. He felt simply that he could not  go on talking about Krishna as the world teacher. He would remain  caught between the commitment he had made to Mrs Besant with the  promise he had made to Nitya, to help Krishna in his work, and his  own awareness that Krishna was not the vehicle. Nevertheless he still  had an inner conviction that in continuing with his part of ?(r)the Work',  editing and arranging Krishna's talks, he would be realizing not only his  own dharma but also fulfilling the expectations that had been placed on  him by Leadbeater and Mrs Besant. However, from then on he would  stay in the background.
