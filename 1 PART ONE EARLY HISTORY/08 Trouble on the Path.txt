    Trouble on the Path 
    The ?(r)process' continued through the summer and autumn at Ojai but  without the ecstatic aspects. Krishna appeared to suffer only the physical  discomforts. In certain circumstances these would continue to manifest  themselves throughout the years to come. The ?(r)process' only occurred in  Rosalind's presence ~ at least up until then. Krishna professed to believe  that Rosalind was his long-lost mother. He and Nitya even wrote to  ask Leadbeater if it were possible that she could be the reincarnation  of their mother. The inconvenient fact that Rosalind was nineteen and  their mother had died only seventeen years before was not lost either on  them or Leadbeater, but they hoped that the Masters could account for  such untimely paradoxes. The whole experience of Krishna's, ?(r)process'  had urged both the brothers into a renewed enthusiasm for the work  and service to the Masters, which included Krishna's declaration to  Leadbeater of his love and respect and some apology for his past  obstreperous behaviour. 
    This would be in accordance with Mrs Besant's description of the way  of ?(r)the Path', although, according to that code, Krishna's behaviour had  been far too recalcitrant for one who had passed the second initiation.  Nevertheless Leadbeater appeared not to have doubted that Krishna's  experience under the pepper tree signified that he had passed the third  initiation. The physical symptoms, however, puzzled him. He believed  that both he and Mrs Besant had travelled the same stages on ?(r)the Path'  but without pain. Leadbeater pondered this question for a month while  Krishna awaited his response without total patience. He would never  receive a fully satisfying answer. Leadbeater appeared to find it difficult  to fit Krishna's symptoms into his scheme. In Leadbeater's eyes Krishna  was still a pupil and had a long path ahead, filled with pitfalls, to travel.  His ultimate destiny was not, by any means, assured. On the other  hand, many of the Theosophists surrounding Krishna were willing  to see him as an already perfect being. This made them and their  lives much more immediately meaningful and important. Leadbeater's  insistence on an arduous step-by-step path to divinity might have made

      Krishna impatient, to say the least. Yet in Krishna's public talks with  young Theosophists, with whom he was very busy during this year in  America, he attributed to Leadbeater's training of him his present state  of spiritual development. He was, at the same time, fully conscious  of the permeating religious culture into which he had been born and  of the role his mother had played, during those early pre-discovery  years, in training his young mind to focus on religious figures, Lord  Krishna, Maitreya Buddha, whose pictures were in the family shrine  room. He had been told to meditate three times a day, even briefly,  on great things. 
    But it was Leadbeater who gave him the cohesive and rigorous  training both in habits of thought and of physical care Ал personal  cleanliness being of foremost importance. He repeated to the American  youths Leadbeater's view that there was no virtue in being a filthy holy  man or saint, either Christian or Hindu, though he added rather melo- dramatically that Leadbeater's nagging about cleanliness had made him  temporarily miserable. In 1923 he was still willing to grant Leadbeater  a vital role in his training on these levels and he advocated for others  the programme Leadbeater had laid out for him: to read a great many  novels in order to gain varied points of view and ideas; to learn about  ways of life different from one's own, even to read trash; above all,  read religious books. 
    The fickleness of Krishna's affections for Leadbeater would continue  for some years, resolving, on certain occasions, into a display of  abhorrence at the very mention of Leadbeater's name. This attitude  on Krishna's part would one day be the cause of a serious quarrel  between him and Nitya, for Nitya remained true to his protectors and  to Theosophy. 
    When the autumn rains came to Ojai in early November, after the  usual six months' dry period, Krishna was enchanted by the miracle of  green sprouting through the parched dry brown of the terrain. He saw  it was a green unlike that of the spring in a cold climate which comes  with a gentle mellowing of the weather. In California the grass appears  almost overnight, laid like a carpet over the contours of the hills. Tender  shoots of poison oak emerge on the dry stalks. The dark green leaves of  the live oaks, washed clean from the summer dust, shine. The streams  run with crystal water over the white granite rocks. Krishna would  carry this image of California with him ever after. 
    The brothers' love for the Ojai Valley increased, as did their longing  to have their own home. With donations raised by Mrs Besant, mostly  from Miss Dodge, the six-acre property adjacent to Mary Gray's estate 
    64  
 
                   
Trouble on the Path 
    was purchased for them. This land included the cottage where they  had been staying and the large, L-shaped main house with patio and  front veranda. This they named Arya Vihara (house of the Aryan or  nobleman) even though it was merely a ramshackle California redwood  ranch house, poorly furnished and in need of paint. Later Miss Dodge  bought for them another seven acres so that the privacy of their property  was safeguarded. Krishna was already astute enough to refuse to own  property personally, perhaps realizing that a young man with his spiritual  future must appear to be materially unencumbered. A trust called the  Brothers Association had been formed to hold the estate. Of course  this was in any case a necessity, for under the California land laws of  that time Orientals, as Indians were incorrectly categorized, could not  own land. Whatever the technicalities involved, Arya Vihara was to be  Krishna's beloved home for many years. Yet there would always be  an ambivalence in him which made him long for India when he was  in California and for California when he was in India. 
    By June 1923, Nitya's health was vastly improved and the brothers  finally returned to Europe. Rosalind did not go with them. For her and  for Nitya the parting was sad and difficult. The love between them had  become very strong. But they had both realized that in Krishna's circle  ?(r)the Work' was all important and the pursuit of personal happiness must  take second place. 
    Meanwhile Raja had been spared the endless distractions and excitement  generated around Mrs Besant and the brothers. While they were in India  and California, he had been able to concentrate totally on his studies  and had just passed the first set of examinations for the Tripos. Life  at Cambridge suited him to the centre of his being. He was a natural  scholar, his life was comfortable, and he quickly won the respect of his  tutor. * 
    In deference to Nitya's health, it was arranged that August would be  spent in Ehrwald in the Austrian Tyrol, where a chalet had been lent  to Krishna. Raja was invited to join the large party, which included  Lady Emily with her daughters, Betty and Mary, Helen Knothe, Ruth  Roberts and Marcelle de Manziarly. 
    During this seven-week holiday Raja was for the first time on hand,  (though not actually present) during Krishna's ?(r)process'. When the  ?(r)process' started again in Ehrwald there was no pepper tree; no music,  or great star, or shiming beings and, of course, no Rosalind. In any  case Krishna would not have wanted her; for now very definitely he  wanted Helen. 
    65      To those on the sidelines with their imaginations and expectations  ripe for a miraculous happening, the atmosphere seemed charged with  powerful presences. Most of them felt encompassed by extraordinary  vibrations. But the whole business of Krishna's ?(r)process', in spite of  the assumed implications, must have been worrying if not terrifying  to Nitya. While similar experiences had been claimed by Blavatsky and  other Theosophists, as well as occultists at large, according to Leadbeater  they had not recorded having Krishna's physical misery. Yet Nitya and  Krishna were not receiving any clear diagnoses either medical (for they  would not consult regular doctors) or occult (from their usual source,  Leadbeater). In accordance with Krishna's wishes, it was still a matter  of extreme privacy and very few people were supposed to know of it.  Although not untypically in such situations, the very cloak of secrecy  warmed and spread the secret. 
    In September the party removed to Eerde Castle in Holland. A trust  was being set up to hold the castle for, as with Arya Vihara, Krishna  maintained that he did not want personally to own property. 
    When I last saw Eerde Castle it had survived the Second World  War and was a private boarding school. The moat was dry and the  romantic atmosphere of a magnificent early eighteenth-century castle  was diminished. As a child, I remembered the large fish swimming in  the moat, fed by a natural stream, and the row of great trees lining the  long entrance drive. The property encompassed five thousand acres of  pine forest with small ponds and farms. It was an unbelievable gift to  anyone Ал even a world teacher. 
    The impetuous love that Krishna had proclaimed for Helen the  previous year had mellowed considerably, in spite of her help with  his ?(r)process', although he still continued for a few years to write love  letters to her. 
    Nitya had now become close friends with Raja. That summer he  had asked Raja to take a year's leave of absence from Cambridge and  return with them both to Ojai for the following winter, as he felt his  presence might be a help if the ?(r)process' were to continue at Ojai. This  Raja agreed to do. He had heard at length about Rosalind from Nitya,  whose love for her touched Raja. (Much later he would tell Rosalind  that he thought he had fallen in love with her listening to Nitya talk  about her on the train across America.) 
    Serious as the framework of their lives might have been, they were  still young and certainly capable of enjoying the possibilities of romance  and falling in love. There was never any question of a triangle. They  were all very close and Raja would keep to himself whatever serious 
    66  
 
                   
Trouble on the Path 
    feelings he had for Rosalind. He would never have interposed himself  between her and Nitya. Fortunately neither Nitya nor Raja had jealous  or possessive natures. 
    Now Rosalind had three young Indians to care for. She found in Raja,  as had Nitya, a steadfast friend. He taught her to play chess and the love  for this game would be a long bond between them. While Raja would  never be much of an athlete, he became quite good at badminton, a  game at which Krishna excelled. 
    Rosalind stayed with Erma in what was now called Pine Cottage,  which her mother had once occupied, while the young men moved into  Arya Vihara. This they all set about to paint in the Victorian dАД|cor of  cream yellow with dark green trim. Supposedly they were all sharing in  the cooking and housework too, but it does not take much imagination  to picture who really did the work, putting up with token help from  three young men who had never attempted such chores. 
    Work was relieved by walks together in the hills and trips with the ever  generous and loving Ingelmans to the Grand Canyon and to Yosemite. It  should have been a very happy existence for all four young people in that  idyllic valley. Rosalind was preparing for Radcliffe which she intended  to enter in the autumn and was being tutored in French by Mary Gray,  in algebra by Raja and in poetry by Nitya. These latter sessions were  her greatest delight and Nitya's exceptionally beautiful voice as he read  poetry would linger in her memory for the rest of her life. 
    One day, feeling his health strengthening, Nitya expressed his hopes  to Krishna that he might marry Rosalind. But as with all his previous  personal yearnings, these hopes were abruptly dashed. He came to  Rosalind with a sadness she had never seen in him before and said  that Krishna had been outraged by the idea and had insisted that his  younger brother must dedicate himself solely to ?(r)the Work'. Much as  she loved Nitya, marriage was still far from Rosalind's mind. Neither  would it ever be a tendency in her to worry about the future. 
    There was another aspect not so idyllic to that summer, which  caused pain not only for himself but for those around him. Krishna  again started his ?(r)process', which continued unabated for weecks and  weeks. This time he refused to have Rosalind near him and occa- sionally called instead for the absent Helen, but mostly he wanted  no one. 
    Having read the accounts of the ?(r)process' the year before and of the  role Rosalind had played, Raja was struck by the bewilderment he saw  in Rosalind at Krishna's sudden rejection of her. Privately his heart  went out to her. Who would have guessed that the hurt in Krishna's 
    67      heart was behind this rejection? His feelings for Rosalind would remain  undeclared as long as Nitya lived (as would Raja's), but he might well  have foreseen in Raja yet another rival for her love and this in a man  he had already seen as a rival on another front. Yet Raja was gentle  and affectionate with a fun-loving side to his shy and often serious  nature. It was hard to dislike him. Krishna even admired many of his  qualities. 
    Krishna and Nitya were aware that Raja was also a protegАД| of Miss  Dodge. Krishna was curious as to whether Raja was receiving an income  comparable to theirs and often questioned Raja about this. Raja, who  had been informed of their allotment, refused to discuss his finances with  Krishna. He realized that the fact he was receiving a substantially larger  income Ал perhaps because of his expenses at Cambridge, but perhaps  also because of Miss Dodge's special confidence in him Ал would only  cause some resentment in Krishna. That he was right in this assumption  was soon indicated. 
    One day he asked Rosalind to go to Hollywood with him to help  him buy his own car. He had saved money for this but did not  know how to drive. He and Rosalind returned to Arya Vihara in the  late afternoon, driving up in a modest enough Buick. Raja, feeling  delighted with his new possession and expecting his excitement to  be shared by his friends, was taken aback to be greeted by Krishna's  scorn and disapproval. Krishna had by then received a series of much  more elegant automobiles. In fact that year, through the generos- ity of John Ingelman, he was the proud possessor of a pale blue  Lincoln. 
    ?(r)That car cannot remain here,?А└ Krishna decreed. ?(r)It is not appro- priate for us to have two cars on this place. You must take it right  back.' 
    Raja, though somewhat shaken, ignored this command, the first but  far from the last such encounter he would have with Krishna. This early  though minor mutual clash of character between them could have been  taken as a significant forecast for the future. 
    Krishna would always assume a superior attitude toward Raja when it  came to cars and driving. He considered himself a first-rate driver and  Raja a very erratic one, although it was he and not Raja who chalked  up speeding tickets and had several near fatal accidents. Automobiles  would always play a special part in Krishna's life. He had learned well  from Miss Dodge's chauffeur how to wash and polish a car. Although  he made an effort to appear mechanical and showed a great interest in  the engine he never developed true skill as a mechanic.

  Trouble on the Path 
    In spring 1924, before the three young men were to return to England,  Krishna prevailed upon Rosalind to give up Radcliffe and go instead  to Australia, to stay in the Manor House and be ?(r)brought on' by  Leadbeater, who believed that her care of Nitya had entitled her to  be placed on probation. Erma, much as she would have cherished a  higher education for her younger sister, undoubtedly was too good a  Theosophist to challenge Krishna's advice. There was certainly no one  else prepared to do so. Rosalind, while not believing in the Masters,  did not strongly disbelieve either and was willing to defer to Krishna's  judgment. It was arranged that she would go down by boat with a  well-to-do Dutch Theosophist, Koos Van der Leeuw, as her guardian.  Again Sophia proved herself to be an exceptionally unpossessive and  tolerant mother. Rosalind was very dear to her and had been a great  support since leaving Buffalo. Although Sophia never came to espouse  any of the Theosophists' notions, she didn't interfere with her daughter's  future among them. 
    That summer of 1924, the first Star Camp was held in Ommen on the  new land given by Baron van Pallandt. The conditions for most of the  few hundred people who attended Ал those not privileged to stay in the  castle Ал were extremely primitive. Krishna's topic included the qualities  needed for the path of discipleship Ал a concept he would soon reject  completely. Raja had accompanied the brothers there before returning  in the autumn to Cambridge to finish his degrees in law and history.  He could not have guessed that summer how deeply he would soon  be involved in these camps. 
    Nearly the same group as the previous year went on to a holiday at  Pergine, in the Italian Dolomites, where a square-towered castle had  been converted to a small hotel overlooking a pristine lake. Krishna and  his companions would always be blessed with the most scenic holiday  spots the world had to offer. But at this time, the ostensible purpose  of these close gatherings of friends was to learn from Krishna the way  of ?(r)the Path', to have serious meditations, and to hope that his evolved  condition would somehow pull them along. This high purpose did not  preclude those frequent moments of fun and games and sometimes  off-colour jokes, instigated by Krishna himself and often bolstered by  the mischievous streak in Raja. Unexpected outbreaks of mild ribaldry  bewildered and shocked some among Krishna's circle of devotees and  charmed others, who felt he could never be tainted by vulgarity, even  his own, and that the very perfection of his being could elevate such  behaviour to a higher plane. 
    69      Once again the ?(r)process' continued with Krishna, on his own as at  Ojai, except for Nitya's presence. The agony he appeared to suffer was  again heartrending for the younger brother, now even more frail. In  California, Dr Strong had warned that Nitya should never return to  India or he might die. But as usual Nitya's well-being did not receive  first priority. Krishna disregarded medical opinion in preference to that  of the Masters Ал or his own judgment. Nitya's place beside Krishna in  the work had been so strongly emphasized by the Masters that it was  difficult for those who believed in them to think they would permit  anything to happen to Nitya. Krishna advised, just as he had advised  Rosalind, that Lady Emily should take her two youngest daughters,  Mary and Betty, to Leadbeater in Sydney to be ?(r)brought on'. He also  advocated the same course for Helen Knothe and Ruth Roberts, the  young woman he had found so attractive in Sydney in 1922. 
    Mary Lutyens, at the age of sixteen, had developed a strong attach- ment for Nitya, whom she had known since she was three. It seems  unlikely that he could have felt more than a brotherly affection for her  for he had told both Krishna and Raja and others close to him such as  Mme de Manziarly and Mary's own mother, Lady Emily, that Rosalind  was the love of his life. But he had not yet told Mary. He did tell her that  he had haemorrhaged again just before they landed in Bombay. He had  also warned her that things would be very different once they reached  India, the constant crowds of people around Krishna, the meetings  each morning in his room, including all the ?(r)gopis', the group of  young women who had followed him from Europe. (Gopis, in Hindu  mythology, were the cow girls that flocked around Lord Krishna and  with one of whom, Radha, he fell in love.) 
    Nitya's condition declined from then on and he would never again  be strong. In India he tried to keep going and to accompany Krishna  on the arduous whirlwind of activities and meetings, but it was soon  evident that he was too ill to participate. 
    There was another problem that no one would know of until Nitya  saw Rosalind again in Sydney. He was becoming increasingly disturbed  by Krishna's behaviour toward the Theosophists and in particular their  old friends and protectors. Privately to Nitya Krishna was making  sarcastic and sneering comments and paying no attention to his brother's  objections. Nitya's escalating illness may have made him more sensitive  than usual, but he felt he could not deter Krishna. Neither could he  endure behaviour which ultimately hurt him so deeply that he withdrew  from Krishna and preferred not to talk to him at all. Krishna, meanwhile,  appeared to be oblivious to his brother's feelings and continued in his 
    70  
 
                   
Trouble on the Path 
    behaviour and activities. He was elated to be back in Adyar, even though 
    Nitya had not been able to accompany him. Nitya had gone up to the 
    hill station of Ootacamund with Mme de Manziarly to care for him. 
    ?(r)Ooty' in those days was as close to paradise as one could get in India; 
    a pine-studded retreat that rose above tiers of coffee and tea plantations. 
    There was a maharaja's villa and many more modest and not so modest 
    villas of well-to-do British. There were clear lakes and mountain walks 
    and the friendly Toda tribal people who lived in huts on the hillsides. 
    But for Nitya, lying ill and lonely in an isolated cottage with no one 
    but Mme de Manziarly Ал devoted though she was Ал for company, life 
    could not have been very bright. 
    The significance of Nitya's silent withdrawal must finally have touched 
    Krishna. One night he had a dream in which he had gone to the Master's 
    house to beg that Nitya would get well and live. Finally he was led to the 
    Mahachohan himself, before whom he vowed that he would sacrifice 
    anything if only Nitya could live. In telling of this vision, or visit, 
    Krishna was admitting his direct experience with the Mahachohan, but 
    it did little to help Nitya, who felt himself once more on the edge of 
    death. 
    Rosalind had arrived in Sydney in the previous June, 1924. On the  voyage down, there happened to be on board the American Davis cup  team, which made her time aboard ship anything but dreary with dances  every night and deck games during the day. What did the serious-minded  chaperon, Koos Van der Leeuw think of all this? At the time about forty,  he was a rather stern and upright Dutchman who felt it his duty to send  her to bed at a reasonable hour and to try to keep her mind on the  serious purpose for which she was going to Australia. While Rosalind  had even then a serious enough side to her nature, it is doubtful that he  was very successful in this endeavour. However, Koos and his brother 
    Kees remained her close lifelong friends. 
    The Manor House was something of a monstrosity. Situated across 
    the harbour from Sydney with a lovely view, it was inhabited by as 
    many as fifty people at a time. The overall management was soon 
    assigned to the capable Koos, who put Rosalind in charge of the meals 
    and dining-room. Her knowledge of a proper vegetarian diet learned 
    from John Ingelman was a great help to her. Being a vegetarian at 
    that time was not always easy and there were very few people who 
    understood how to make a balanced diet of it. 
    Affairs at the house were in a bad way. The servants were unreliable 
    and stole constantly, even though they all had impeccable references. 
    71  
 
                   
 
    One day Rosalind went down to the employment agency and sat and  watched applicants come and go. At length a rosy-cheeked young man  walked in who had a rustic and ingenuous appearance. ?(r)I will take  him,' she told the agent, who warned her that he had no references  or experience. ?(r)I will take him anyway.?А└ The young man turned out  to be hard working and devoted and ended up staying with Leadbeater  for many years. Although Rosalind worked hard, there was the com- panionship of other young people, the opportunity occasionally to go  riding in the hills, play tennis and to swim in the shark-ridden waters  (supposedly protected from sharks by nets across the harbour and a  watch that fired a cannon if sharks were spotted). 
    On Hallowe'en night when there was a serious occult meeting going  on, Rosalind and some of her less pious friends dressed in sheets  and terrified the occupants of the hall by appearing in the windows.  Bishop Leadbeater could not have been too formidable if these young  people would dare play such a prank on him. Rosalind did annoy him  considerably once when she moved his cat off a chair on which she  hoped to sit.. As to training of any sort on a higher plane, there was  none that she could discern, unless it was taking place without her  awareness. 
    Krishna and Nitya left India for Australia in early March 1925, still in  the company of Lady Emily, her two daughters and Jinarajadasa. There  were stops on the way in Colombo, Fremantle, Perth, Adelaide and  Melbourne, at several of which tracts of land were offered to Krishna  and thousands came to hear him speak. All this did Nitya no good  and the little ground his health had gained in Ootacamund was quickly  lost. During the voyage Krishna decided that they must return as soon  as possible to Ojai and take Rosalind from Sydney with them to look  after Nitya. By the time they arrived in Sydney Nitya had suffered  another haemorrhage. 
    On 3 April 1925, the brothers with their entourage sailed into Sydney  Harbour. One look at Nitya convinced Rosalind of his critical condition;  everyone concerned feared he would not get through the night. It was in  a quiet house away from the Manor on that first night that Nitya, ill as  he was, burst into sobs and told Rosalind how miserable he had been  over Krishna's behaviour toward the Theosophists, of his sarcasm and  the ridiculing even of Mrs Besant behind her back. Krishna had never  publicly, or privately so far as anyone has revealed, spoken a word  against Mrs Besant; therefore what Nitya had to say that night is an  extremely important glimpse into his brother's inner feelings. He was  the one person before whom Krishna would have felt safe to speak 
    72  
 
                   
Trouble on the Path 
    his mind. Nitya told Rosalind he was so upset over it that he had  not spoken to Krishna for three'months. He swore her to secrecy and  went on to say how the whole strain of that had added to his already  desperate condition. 
    Rosalind was concerned that night only for Nitya. When morning  came she could think of nothing else than that he was still alive. The  next day Krishna came to her in a most unhappy mood and begged  her to find out what was wrong. He could no longer avoid recognizing  that Nitya was upset with him. Rosalind was in a terrible position. She  had given her word to Nitya to say nothing. Yet fearing he would die  and leave Krishna in this state without a reconciliation, she broke her  word, although it caused her a great deal of pain to do so, and told  Krishna how Nitya felt about his behaviour, begging him to make up  the quarrel immediately and warning that if he gave her away she would  never forgive him. Krishna went to his brother at once and whatever he  said appeared to have relieved Nitya's distress. Krishna kept his promise  to Rosalind. 
    Krishna was determined that Rosalind should return with them to  Ojai and gave her the impression that he had to stand up adamantly  to Leadbeater to ensure this. Leadbeater, Krishna said, felt she should  remain in Sydney. Leadbeater undoubtedly found her useful but may  well have had his more occult reasons too. However, Krishna won and  Leadbeater finally gave his blessing to her going back to Ojai. 
    In spite of his reconciliation with Nitya, Krishna found the schism  between himself and Leadbeater widening. He allowed his boredom to  show at the lengthy rituals that were all important in the Liberal Catholic  Church and he mocked the ?(r)gopis' for their participation, even though  he had suggested that they come to Sydney to be with Leadbeater. He  did not need to mock Rosalind. She had never developed any interest in  that aspett of Theosophy. In fact one might well wonder what benefit  on a spiritual or intellectual level her whole year in Sydney had been.  She had found a fair share of good times and had worked hard to keep  the Manor dining-room running smoothly. It was not in her nature to  question whether that year might have been better spent at Radcliffe,  where she was headed before Krishna took her destiny in his hands. 
    By June Nitya was pronounced by the specialist well enough to sail  to California. Krishna had sent for John Ingelman to come all the way  to Australia from Los Angeles to accompany them back, and help to  care for Nitya.
