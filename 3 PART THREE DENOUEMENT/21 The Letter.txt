    The Letter 
    Krishna's year of retreat in Ojai had done much to heal his relationship  with Rosalind, but he still felt it necessary to convince her of his loyalty.  Shortly before his departure from Ojai in autumn 1952, he gave her the  pencil copy ofa letter he had written to Nandini. He said he was going  to carry the original, of which this was an exact duplicate, to deliver in  person. This gesture of Krishna's did not mean as much to Rosalind as  he might have hoped. She still remembered the letter he had written in  Ommen, which she now knew had never been delivered to Raja. 
    Thinking that this was very likely to happen again, Rosalind told  Raja that Krishna had written a letter to Nandini and asked that he see  that it was properly delivered. She did not show him her copy and he  was not aware of its existence. 
    Always afraid of indiscreet letters falling into the wrong hands, with  Krishna's approval, Raja agreed to carry the letter among his papers  for safe keeping until they arrived in India. There, unless Rosalind  advised otherwise, he would give it to Krishna to deliver. While Raja  did not wish to involve himself further in the matter, he hoped that the  situation would be resolved as quickly and quietly as possible. He well  understood the strain Rosalind had been under and sympathized, but her 
    -relationship-with Krishna, in addition to the personal anguish it caused  him, had greatly complicated his professional life. Now the last thing he  ~ wanted was to be caught in another triangle, that of Krishna, Rosalind  and Nandini. He had tried all these years, as part of what he felt to be his 
    -duty toward Krishna and ?(r)the Work', to protect both from the muddles  and messes that Krishna too often generated around him. He did not  ?¡ãregard this letter as a prudent course for Krishna to take and hoped  Rosalind would encourage Krishna to drop the whole matter. Raja was  wearying of these complications and would gradually withdraw more  and more. He found travelling with Krishna and arranging the details  of his life an increasing source of irritation. 
    From a later vantage point, one can see that the old cornerstone of  their lives together had crumbled disastrously. But at the time they all  
 
                             failed to clarify between themselves exactly what the new cornerstone,  if any, would be. Raja had believed that there was a bond of affection  between the three of them that excluded none of them. The physical  relationship between Krishna and Rosalind had upset the balance. For  him or Rosalind to have become involved with an outside party would  not have had the same impact on their lives. For Krishna to become  involved with anyone at all was in contradiction to the chaste publicimage  he himself had established and to which Raja had lent his trust. Raja felt  that a severe transgression of this trust had taken place but that this  transgression had ended. If he had read the letter, at least the copy that  Krishna left with Rosalind (which may or may not have resembled the  original), Raja would have realized that in Krishna's mind the affair with  Rosalind was far from over. For in that copy of his letter to Nandini,  Krishna stated that there was a woman in his life who had been there  for more than twenty years and that such a relationship was not to be  broken and he didn't intend to break it. He went on to apologize if his  letters or conversations had given a misleading impression and advised 
    Nandini not to build around false hope. 
    As usual, Raja left for London somewhat ahead of Krishna, from  where he wrote to Rosalind before Krishna left Ojai to join him. 
    2nd October, 1952 
    Thank you for your very dear letter which I received on the boat 
    just before sailing. 1 hope you are feeling a little rested. Please don't 
    exhaust yourself. It is better to live doing little than to die doing too 
    much. 
    That special letter is still with me, and I hope to hear from you 
    definitely about it once again before anything is done. 
    London is bitterly cold and dreary. Please tell Krishna to be warmly 
    dressed. Usually he likes to carry his overcoat on one arm and his coat 
    on the other, and freeze and look miserable. 
    Please pat Coco for me, and tell her how much I love her. She is 
    some Coco ¡Ð one can't forget her easily. 
    All my love, 
    RAJA 
    Krishna continued with his daily writings to Rosalind. Ardent affir- mations of his love for her were interspersed with descriptions of people  and scenery and details of their daily existence. Kitty Shiva Rao and her  brother-in-law Sir B.N. Rao, Indian Ambassador to the United Nations,  were on the plane with them as far as Rome. They both stopped off in

The Letter 
    Alexandria to visit the Suar¡§|s, who had a villa there in addition to their 
    apartment in Paris. (They would shortly, under Nasser, lose most of 
    their money and all their holdings in Egypt). Krishna walked with 
    Carlo Suar¡§|s along the beach in Alexandria while Raja slept. That 
    Krishna's concern for his public image was as strong as Raja assumed 
    it to be was graphically tested a few days later. There came what was 
    for Krishna a nerve-racking episode. Ready to depart from Bombay in 
    Cairo airport, they were temporary victims of the domestic tensions in 
    Egypt. In customs every shoe and every pocket was felt and searched. 
    Officials read all the letters that Raja was carrying but by some miracle 
    missed the one intended for Nandini and also the one Krishna was in 
    the process of writing to Rosalind and had not yet mailed. He mailed 
    it from Bombay, expressing his resolve never again to be caught with 
    such a letter on his person. He thanked God they hadn't found the 
    letter to Nandini either. Before closing, he resumed the pattern of 
    his previous letters from India, stressing Raja's close association with 
    Pupul and Nandini, while he, Krishna stayed home alone writing to  Rosalind, feeling her closeness and his love for her and asserting that  all the ado about ?(r)that other person' was faded and forgotten. 
    For the next four months Rosalind was given almost daily excuses  for why the letter had still not been delivered to Nandini. At first  Raja was the reason. Krishna claimed that Raja refused to turn over  the letter saying it should not be delivered as it would cause gossip and  involve him and Rosalind. Krishna assured Rosalind that he tried each  day to bring up the subject and got nowhere. He said he would not  give up, even if it meant writing another letter and sending i1t without  Raja's approval. This he somehow never got around to doing. By  mid-December he had a new excuse. Nandini's health was poor and  Krishna was worried that she did not have the strength to read such  a letter, so delivery would have to be postponed. After that Krishna  and Raja went to Benares and from there, according to Krishna,  it was not safe to mail the letter as the mail was easily tampered  with. 
    Rosalind had long since realized that the letter would not be delivered 
    -and was too involved with her work to give it much more thought.  In Krishna's absence the whole matter lost its significance. She made  no effort to communicate with Raja about it. Later, Raja claimed  he had long before handed it over to Krishna, there had not been  those endless discussions and he forgot about it, never suspecting  that he had been worked into Krishna's dissemblance. What had evi~  -dently occupied a considerable amount of Krishna's thought had been  239  
 
                             pushed to the background by both Rosalind and Raja. By February  the subject was dropped for ever and no more was heard of the  letter. 
    Raja's health was poor that year. Krishna thought Raja had strained  something doing yoga, which he had been persuaded by Krishna to  take up. He found it hard to swallow and developed an intermittent  pain in his oesophagus. This would become a chronic problem with  serious side effects and I would later wonder if the cause was not yoga  but that there had just been too many things for him to ?(r)swallow'. He  gave only a hint of this in his letters to my mother: 
    Poona Jan 12, 1953  Rosalind Darling, 
    I received the only letter, since I arrived in India, that you have  written. I have been. I know, very remiss, and I am very sorry.  Not a day has passed without my thinking of you with deep love  . . . Please remember letters get lost here very easily, or opened &  thrown away ¡Ð So write guardedly & do not forget to glue and seal  properly. 
    Of course 1 shall be there for Radha's graduation or even before 
    ¡Ð Hope all goes well ¡Ð Thinking of you constantly with deepest  love,  RAJA 
    Bombay March 1, 1953  Thank you, Darling, for the 2 cables. The first one made me rather  worried & then a few hours later came the good news. I am very  happy, all is well. 
    How is the new Baby & how is her dear, darling mother? To think  of Radhi with a baby girl. Incredible!! What name has the Baby? I  wonder if Radha & Jimmy liked my suggestion? 
    All my love, always,  RAJA  [handwritten on the bottom of typed letter]  Things are not right for me here. I am afraid finally so. Well - That is the end of the long matter. However I shall go on - 
   Krishna made it clear to Rosalind too. in his own way that things  were not right between him and Raja. He was justifiably indignant  that Raja failed to inform him when Jimmy's and my baby was born.  It was twelve days after the news had come, before Raja mentioned

                         The Letter 
    it to him, a clear indication of estrangement, large or small, between  them. 
    Yet another cause for conflict was on the horizon. Lady Emily  wanted to publish Candles in the Sun, the autobiography of her years  with Theosophy and Krishna. Once again Raja would be the scapegoat  during the period of bitter controversy that would ensue.
