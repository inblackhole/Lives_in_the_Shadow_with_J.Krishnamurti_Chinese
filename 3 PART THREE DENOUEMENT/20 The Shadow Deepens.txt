    The Shadow Deepens 
    In the autumn of 1947 Krishna, fully recovered, left Ojai on his first  trip abroad since before the war. Raja went with him as far as England  and stayed in Europe until the following spring while Krishna went on  to India. Rosalind remained in Ojai, absorbed by the school. 
    Krishna was to remain away for a year and a half. He had never lost his  attachment to the country of his birth and in the last seven years he must  have yearned for it. Yet from the moment of his departure from QOjai and  Rosalind, he resumed the correspondence with her that had been a daily  routine in his absences before the war. His letters continually reaffirmed  his love for her and the importance of their relationship; letters which  Rosalind seldom answered, for she did not look on them as a form of  correspondence but as a need in him to communicate his inner thoughts  to someone close. He did not expect her to write and in fact urged her,  as he often did me, not to bother. 
    Soon after his arrival in Bombay, Krishna met a very beautiful young  woman, Nandini Mehta, who was married to a Bombay businessman, and  her sister Pupul. In May, he went with these two sisters to Ootacamund.  In their presence, for the first time in twenty years, the ?(r)process' recurred.  Except for one time in Ojai when he had wanted no one, Krishna had  always'wan?(r)ted a woman to help him through the ?(r)process'. Nandini  would not be the last. This recurrence was very similar to those of the  past; weeping and calling for his mother, the pain in the head, the strange  voice, widened eyes, different face and a general plea for care of the body.  And as in his Theosophical days, there was evidently no question raised  by those present of a psychological or physical disorder. 
    In April 1949 Krishna returned to Ojai. It had been the longest 
    separation between him and Rosalind since they had met in 1922. At 
    first it seemed that their relationship would continue as it had for the 
    past seventeen years, surviving his long absences before the war and 
    the close confinement during it. They seemed happy to see each other. 
    Involved as she was with the school, he gave her support and advice in 
    her new work. On her side, she managed to get away from Ojai for 
    215  
 
                   
 
    the spring holidays and go with Krinsh and me to Wrightwood. 
    I had grown up with the knowledge that my parents had a peculiar  marriage and I had always felt, and on several occasions had even  observed, that the true marriage in our house was between my mother  and Krinsh. This never bothered me in the least, perhaps because I was  too young to judge. And I was brought up to ?(r)judge not'; Aldous used  to say that was one of the most important precepts in the Bible. Anyhow  by that spring I was deeply absorbed in a love of my own. 
    From the moment he had arrived to attend the school in the autumn of  1946, Jimmy Sloss and I had felt a bond which some of our Theosophical  elders described as the meeting of ?(r)old souls' but which we took more  prosaically for falling in love. Neither of us had the background to  be flattered by this reference to old souls. Hopefully if we had, we  would have had the sense to realize that it was our proximity to the  charmed circle, rather than any merits of our own, that drew forth  such conjectures. It would be a source of happiness and reassurance to  us both that we would have in the future such wholehearted approval  from both immediate family and close friends, for we would marry  very young. There would be a few years of separation after Happy  Valley School, however, before we came together for good. Jimmy  went off a year ahead of me to college in the east. In June 1949 I  graduated from the Happy Valley School and was looking forward to  going east to Swarthmore College where I had been accepted, as had  my cousin David. I was still surrounded by loving adults both within  the family and without. Mima Porter gave me a beautiful long satin  dress that my mother and I had fancied in a shop window in Santa  Barbara but felt was not affordable. My mother spent the summer in  Wrightwood with Krinsh and me, making my college wardrobe. 
    Most unexpectedly, a few days before my departure, Krinsh handed  me a hundred dollar bill to buy a warm coat in Philadelphia, the first  material gift I had ever had from him. And Iris Tree wrote for me the  following poem: 
    For Radha 
    Wherever you go 
    Wherever the winds blow 
    May there be singing 
    May there be flight 
    Of clouds alight 
    And wild birds winging 
    216  
 
                         The Shadow Deepens 
    Wherever the winds rest  And the birds come to nest  To you the dove - On you through the winds stirring  Through the blind darkness living  The eyes of those you love. 
    While my adolescent self-centredness had largely insulated me from  the realities of that summer, I could not escape noticing a new tension  between my mother and Krinsh. It was not happy tension but one  which led to quarrels quickly suppressed by my presence. It would be  more than twenty years before I knew the cause. 
    At first Rosalind had found her relationship with Krishna ostensibly  unchanged. He seemed eager to return to the intimacy they had shared  before his illness. But once he called her by Nandini's name; a name  which at that time she did not know. She tried to convince herself1t was  just a vague and befuddled slip of the tongue. But when this happened  again with the same name, she was perturbed. It had not occurred to  Rosalind that disloyalty could enter into this relationship. For the reasons  already mentioned, she did not consider herself unfaithful to Raja, just  as she would not have felt betrayed by any haison that he might have  made. But where Krishna was concerned, at the very least she would  have expected to be informed if he were interested in someone else. As  her suspicion grew she finally questioned him. He denied absolutely  that there was anyone else in his life or could ever be anyone but her.  Rosalind was not as gullible and naive as she had once been, and the  vehemence of his denials made her all the more suspicious. Later she  would ?(r)claim it was the uncertainty more than his suspected disloyalty  that upset her. Over the years she had come to realize that Krishna was  not always a truthful person and as he himself had told her that his lies  stemmed from fear, she tried to reassure him that there would be no  difficult consequences whatsoever if he would just tell her the truth.  She said she could accept if he were in love with someone else and they  could go on being friends, but she could not endure being deceived. 
    Ovwer the years, fear and its origins such as death, ambition, insecurity,  had been important themes in Krishna's talks. It had always struck me  that those problems he talked about with the most profound insight were  those problems he struggled with in himself. Others have thought this  too, but then wondered, as I did not, how he could speak so knowingly  about sex and love. 
    217  
 
                             Krishna's adamant protestations of fidelity to Rosalind were consider- ably undercut when, six months later, after he had returned to Europe,  the following article appeared in Time magazine. 
    REVOLT OF A DOORMAT  Among the great fads of the 1920s {was] . . . Jiddu Krishnamurti . . .  a long-haired young Indian seer whom Bernard Shaw once called the  most beautiful human being he had ever seen. The Theosophist Annie  Besant had adopted Krishnamurti, and was freely predicting that he  would be a new messiah. He was more modest. ?(r)I may or may not be  the second Christ Ал I don't know,?А└ he once said. ?(r)I don't want people  to look up to me, to worship me. Most people are dumb anyway.'  Bunkum & Nonsense. Almost as if to prove it, thousands of disciples 
    Ал mostly women Ал used to gather to listen to his lectures on ?(r)truth  and love' . . .  Two years ago, close to 50 and still handsome, Krishnamurti  returned to India and relative obscurity . . . Last week he was  in the news again, involved in one of India's rare cases of marital  dissolution. 
    After nearly ten years of marriage, the wife of 2 Bombay textile  millionaire, Bhagvandas Chunilal [sic] Mehta asked for a legal sepa- ration. She testified that Mehta beat her, locked up her medicines  and used insulting language. Then Mehta took the stand with his  side of the story. His wife had become a disciple of Krishnamurti.  She had heard him call the sacred Hindu wedding verses ?(r)bunkum  and nonsense'. At another lecture Krishnamurti said to the males in  the audience: ?(r)Do you know what your relationship with your wife is?  We all know this relationship -sex, nagging, bullying, dominating,  the superficial responses of marriage . . . If you are dominant and  you make her your doormat, you say: I am happily married.' 
    As a result of listening to such teaching Mrs Mehta's attitude toward  her husband had changed sharply. ?(r)Before she was always strong, but  good,?А└ said Mehta. ?(r)Afterwards . . . she became aggressive . . . I had  come to the conclusion that under the guise of teaching, Krishnamurti  was running after my wife.' 
    Resentment & Rupture. Declaring that her eyes had been opened  by Krishnamurti's teachings, Mrs Mehta had told her husband she  would live a celibate life and had moved into the dressing room.  Judge Eric Weston . . . denied Mrs Mehta's petition. He dryly  observed: I do not think there is any room for doubt that the  teachings [of Krishnamurti] suggesting revolt of the wife from her 
    218  
 
                   
The Shadow Deepens 
    doormat position must have had their effect upon her mind . . .  This led to her refusal to carry on marital relations with her husband,  which must have caused considerable resentment.'! 
    Rosalind knew a side of Krishna that was undreamed of by Raja. She  could read between the lines and believe that Mr Mehta might have some  truth on his side. Raja's only concern was to protect Krishna from such  notoriety. He went to considerable pains to persuade Time not to go on  with this story. It was the first unpleasant publicity since the 1920s. It  was quite disconcerting to him that the moment Krishna took off on  his own he had become embroiled in such an unsavoury situation. 
    Rosalind noted the obvious inaccuracies in the article while believing  that Nandini was a passive and innocent party. She realized it was quite  possible that Krishna had become infatuated without his affections being  reciprocated Ал at least in kind. But she was still convinced he had not  been truthful about his own feelings. 
    In spite of the trouble Krishna had landed in during the previous  year Raja again refrained from accompanying him to India in 1950.  Krishna had often been the subject of various rumours, unfounded in  even a grain of reality. Rosalind's suspicions would not have occurred  to Raja. Besides, he had a lot of work to do in Ojai. The three of them  planned to meet in Europe in the spring. 
    When Rosalind arrived in London, her first trip there since 1936, she  met up with many old friends some of whom, like Kitty Shiva Rao, had  just come from India. She heard innuendoes that had been circulating  about Krishna and his new friends. She was deeply disturbed and was  further convinced that Krishna had refused to be truthful with her; for  his letters, in which he supposedly described to her every detail of his  life, did not correspond with what she heard. According to these reports  he was not always in the place that he claimed to her to be and Nandin1's  name was frequently linked with his. Krishna never mentioned her in  his letters to Rosalind. There was no one with whom Rosalind could  discuss her distress. For many years she had carried that secret part of  her life with ease for it had been relatively happy. Now in her misery  the burden was becoming unbearable. She lost weight and was unable  to shake off a feeling of malaise that had started on the transatlantic  voyage.. 
    Rosalind went on to Paris, where she was to meet Raja arriving from  California and Krishna arriving from India. On his arrival in Paris on  3 April Raja found her staying in a miserable hotel and immediately  moved her to a better one. He was shocked by her appearance and 
    219  
 
                             state of mind. When she started to tell him the stories she had heard  in London about Krishna, and her conviction that he was involved,  at least emotionally if not physically, with another woman, Raja was  puzzled by the depths of her distress. He could understand his own  distress at the probability of more notoriety, if Rosalind's suspicions  were correct. In his efforts to protect Krishna he would have put himself  in the position of covering up for him and this sort of hypocrisy was  highly repugnant to him. Then suddenly, in her frustration, the whole  story of her relationship with Krishna burst out. It was a tremendous  shock to Raja, to learn of the duration of the affair and particularly  to hear of the pregnancies and subsequent abortions. Looking back on  that traumatic discussion, Rosalind clearly remembered Raja's shock,  and then her shock at realizing that he had not known what she had  assumed Krishna to have told him in that letter long ago in Ommen, 
    a letter Raja had never seen. 
    Krishna arrived in Paris the next day. He was staying as usual with  old friends, the SuarАД|s, in their lovely apartment overlooking the Eiffel  Tower. For years Carlo SuarАД|s had been translating Krishna's books into  French. Both he and his wife Nadine were devoted to Krishna and they  were also very fond of Rosalind. It was difficult to keep her distress from  them. She told Krishna that she had to have a long talk with him, that  she had something important to tell him and asked him to meet her for  a walk. They walked for hours along the Seine, he enchanted by the  lovely spring day in Paris; she seeing nothing as she told him what she  had revealed to Raja. 
    Krishna was at first horrified and then angry, but after a while he  agreed to do as she asked, to talk to Raja about the situation. She felt it  was up to Krishna to make his own peace with Raja. Krishna promised  to do this, but whenever Rosalind asked him if he had yet done so he put  her off with some excuse. It was not the sort of confrontation he would  welcome, any more than he had been able to forewarn Mrs Besant  privately of his defection from Theosophy. Raja, however, assumed  from the way Rosalind had talked about her affair with Krishna, that  it was now over. He felt the most profound sympathy for her and in  no part of his heart held her to blame. He would always see her as a  victim, but Rosalind did not feel victimized. The fact that she had given  Krishna so much of her life and her care did not enter into her thinking.  She harped on one thing only: knowing the truth, and nothing Krishna  said convinced her she was getting it. 
    Rosalind returned to America on 19 April and visited me at 
    Swarthmore on her way back to Ojai. I knew then that she was 
    220  
 
                         The Shadow Deepens 
    very unwell but was given no hint as to the cause and assumed it  was from purely physical origins. 
    When the spring term finished, [ met my father and Krinsh at Sarobia  to spend a few days with Mr Robbie. It was there that one morning  I overheard a terrible quarrel between them. Fortunately we were on  a floor to ourselves, Krinsh staying in what had once been Sara's  bedroom. My door was open and I heard all they said, the gist of it  being that Raja was once again threatening to walk out for good. After  many sharp exchanges Krishna begged Raja to stay and he agreed to  admit in writing that many times over the years he had lied to Raja and  betrayed him in ways he refused to discuss but that he would never do  so again. My father eventually calmed down, but lines of unhappiness  were etched even deeper in his face. 
    The three of us went to New York, where a friend had loaned us  her vacant apartment. I kept house during Krinsh's talks at Town  Hall. Willie had come from Ojai to handle the book sales at the  talks. As always, when surrounded by friends and followers, there  was an appearance of harmony. Indeed peace seemed to have been  restored. There were some pleasant times together, dinners with all  the de Manziarly sisters, my father laughing and teasing in his old  way and Krinsh joining in and sometimes remarking as he often used  to that ?(r)Rajagopal is in very good form and full of jokes.?А└ It would be  many years before I would appreciate the depth of my father's power  of forgiveness. When I asked him years later how he could have gone  on in his relationship with Krinsh, he replied simply, ?АсWhat else could  I do? IfI left him suddenly there would have to be some explanation.  Should I have exposed him and Rosalind and brought all that trouble  on her and on her work in the school? No! I went on with my end  of the work and hoped he would behave after that.?А└ But of course he  didn't. Things only got worse. 
    Raja became more than ever convinced that there were ?(r)two Krishnas',  the one who could speak with such insight about the human condition,  and the other shadowy Krishna who could deceive and betray a man  upon whom he depended and then beg his forgiveness without any  intention of rectifying matters. Perhaps it was easier for Raja to accept  that there were these two Krishnas. Some day Rosalind would arrive  at a similar conclusion. 
    After the New York talks Raja went directly back to Ojai while Krinsh  and I flew to Seattle to meet Rosalind, who had driven up from Ojai with  friends. Krinsh was to give a series of talks there, but first we went for ten  days' rest on the reclusive Orcas Island. In those peaceful surroundings, 
    221  
 
                      whatever tensions there were between Krinsh and my mother seemed  to subside. Perhaps by sharing with Raja the burden of her distrust of  Krinsh, Rosalind had found it possible to regain her own equilibrium.  Back in Seattle for the talks, one day she and Krinsh saw a beautiful  little white Ford convertible in a show window and phoned Raja to ask  him to buy it for them, which he did. 
    Krishna had decided to take a year of retreat in Ojai, ostensibly to  recuperate from general fatigue, but in fact he made a tremendous effort  to heal the rift between himself and Rosalind. On the surface, everything  began to appear much as before. Perhaps Rosalind allowed herself to  half-believe him or at least to push aside her distress, a tendency she  had when things became too difficult. 
    Raja meanwhile buried himself even deeper in his work. Aldous had  introduced him to his publisher at Harper & Row. For many years this  would be a fruitful and vital connection for Raja. He had spent the past  few years preparing manuscripts for publication as Aldous had been  encouraging him to do. Krishna showed not the slightest interest in  this project and would not even look at the manuscripts, but he urged  Raja to carry on, saying that was his part of the work and he had  no wish to be involved in it. Perhaps because of his commitment  to this new project, Raja was able to live with the hurt of Krishna's  deception. He also allowed himself to assume that the relationship  between Krishna and Rosalind was over as he understood Krishna to  have implied. Could he really have gone on with his association with  Krishna if he believed otherwise? Years later he told Mima Porter that  he would have understood people falling in love, that was only human,  but he could not understand Krishna leaving him in darkness all those  years, while living a life so contrary to the life which Raja had believed  he wished them all to live. Perhaps it is the loss of free choice in deciding  one's own course of action that is the worst aspect of being deceived. It  seems unrealistic, knowing the fearfulness in Krishna's nature, to have  expected that he could level with Raja. Raja, however, never saw himself  as an intimidating person. He had always tried to do everything Krishna  wanted and in the way he wanted it, talking over the details of their lives  with great thoroughness. That Krishna was actually agreeing to things  he didn't want would have been hard to guess, yet that 1s what he would  later complain of. That winter all three of them made an attempt to  return to some sort of normality, if anything about their lives could  ever be called normal. 
    Raja wrote to Rosalind, who had again gone east to spend Christmas 
    with me at Sarobia.

                         The Shadow Deepens 
    Jan 13, 1951  Dearest Rosalind, 
    Sorry not to have written to you before. There really wasn't much  to say from here. I still strictly mind my own business, and am very  busy with it. 
    The arrangements you made are working out very well. K. is busy  with his gardening. I think he wants to be an expert in growing roses  and all sorts of flowers. He seems very well and quite well fed, at  least, so he says. 
    I hope you are having a really restful and interesting time, and  that you are feeling all right. When you see Mr Robbie, please give  him my dearest love . . . and of course a big kiss to Radhie. 
    All my love, darling,  RAJA 
    My frequent weekends with Mr Robbie at Sarobia meant the most  to me in those two years in Pennsylvania. He suffered a stroke during  the second year which left him quite immobile, and | would sit with  him in his sunny study downstairs, from which the intimidating Pack  Wack had long since departed, and talk over my term papers. I treasured  those times with him, for his mind was as clear as ever but his paticnce  more mellow. 
    After two years there, I had come to teel Swarthmore was not the  right place for me and when the term was over I decided 1 would  transfer to a college in California. 
    After driving across America with David and our two aunts, I walked  happily into the living-room at Arya Vihara to find my father and Krinsh  engaged in yet another confrontation. My father was glaring in angry  silence while Krinsh, in evident frustration, was pummelling him on  the chest. After my nine months' absence, they scarcely took time off  to greet me. I drove down to the school in search of my mother and  was warmly greeted by a new member of our household; through Iris  Tree a large silvery mocha poodle called Coco had found a home with  Rosalind. As soon as I walked into the main hall, Coco, about whom  had heard much but had never met, rushed up and licked my face. My  mother, observing her dog's acceptance of her daughter, said she had  never done this with anyone else. Coco would prove to be a new and  much-needed bond in our family. 
    When Krishna returned to India in that autumn of 1951, Raja decided  to accompany him. His mother was getting old and he wanted to sce 
    223  
 
                   
 
      her again. He wanted also to see for himself what was going on around  Krishna in India. He went ahead to Europe by train and boat and was  to meet Krishna, who preferred to fly, in England. 
    Whatever Raja's disillusion with Krishna, his affection for Rosalind  had not diminished as his letters to her show. 
    Chicago Sept 13, 1951 
    Dearest Rosalind and Radha, 
    I telt very sad to leave you both and feel very homesick. 
    Thank you both for a really nice resttul time I had at Wrightwood. 
    You will be back in Ojai tomorrow and I'll be in New York. I am  going further and further away.  All my love to you both, Darlings Ал  RAJY 
    And a few days later: 
    Rosalind Dearest, 
    It was so nice talking over the phone with you last Saturday. You  did not sound too well. I do hope, darling, you will be sensible about  yourself& take good care in every way Ал 
    I shall write to you often, & don't forget to send for me should  there be any emergency - Is Krishna's knee better Ал I hope he will rest properly till he has  to leave. Give him & all my love.  With dearest love to you,  RAJY 
    It took Rosalind a month to answer: 
    October 31, 1951  Darling Raja,  The time goes so quickly that I find it hard to write every week  as I see you do. 
    In Hollywood we both went to Dr Lupica and I must say [ like  him very much; he has been very helpful. K did his immigration  business with Willie . . . After we returned to Ojai K got his back  dislocated and we had quite a time with it . . . The Huxleys were  here last weekend and we took him back last Monday to Dr Lupica  and he fixed it and strapped it and it is slowly getting better. | was  quite worried if he would be able to go off as he was quite crippled  from it. Dr Lupica said it is partly due to old age and he would have 
    224  
 
                         The Shadow Deepens 
    to watch it. I hope 1t is all right while he 1s with you in London . . .  The school work seems to take all of one's time and energy and  am trying to get things in a condition where it will not always be  like this. 
    No matter what their emotional state they both were aware always  of their responsibility for Krishna's well-being, and this continued to  be a primary link in their relationship with each other. There was also  frequent mention of Coco. 
    Rosalind's involvement with the school and the people around it  was becoming ever deeper. Lili Kraus, the great Hungarian pianist,  had come the previous spring for the Ojai music festival; Lili became  one of the pivotal points in Rosalind's life, not only because of the deep  affection between them, but also because of Lili's generous sharing of her  enormous talent with the school. She would soon be staying for several  months at Arya Vihara with her husband, Otto Mandl. (Rosalind later  arranged for Lili's favourite 1916 Steinway to be brought to Ojai for  Lili's use on her annual visits.) 
    Aldous and Maria still came regularly and Aldous was now on the  school board. The school took its motto Aun Aprendo, (?(r)I am still  learning') from the graduation address he gave there. The philosopher  Gerald Heard gave several talks, as did Alan Watts, the well-known  writer and lecturer on Buddhism, who later sent his daughter to the  school. A letter from Alan Watts to Blanche Matthias dated 16 March  1951, gives his impression of his first encounter with Ojai. 
    Dear Blanche, 
    I thought I would . . . thank you for your introduction to Rosalind  Rajagopal. We met again at the end of our stay in L. A. and her husband  guided us up to Ojal. 
    I must say I am enormously impressed with Rajagopal. 1 don't  know when I have met such a thoroughly integrated person, at once  so relaxed and so keen in mind . . . and it was a rare pleasure to enjoy  the company of such an amazingly natural human being Ал especially  after meeting, in L.A., so many would-be philosophers, each with  a separate axe to grind. 
    We visited the Happy Valley School, and I had a very interesting  hour's talk with the children. Quite a group! They are wonderfully  alert and free without being offensive, and I like the atmosphere of  the place very much. 
    Most sincerely,  ALAN  
 
                      There was a lengthy list of eminent visitors in all fields who added  an exceptional cultural depth to the school. 
    Being physically close again that whole year in Ojai had done much  to heal the breach between Krishna and Rosalind, at least in Krishna's  mind, as his letters to her would show when he left. He told her  that the struggle had brought them inwardly closer, that she must  not let sadness or anything else come between them and that she  was and always would be in his heart Ал that they were together in  their love. 
    His letters reveal the physical wrench he felt at leaving her and are  a series of impassioned pleas to maintain their relationship at all costs.  Yet his words reflect, along with his love, a physical and psychic  dependency on her. He feels her sitting next to him on the plane  and sharing with him the drifting clouds and the blue sky. He says  they have been through too much to let anything happen to this  inward closeness. He also admonishes her to take regular walks as  much for Coco's sake as for hers and to brush and feed the dog  properly. 
    When Krishna met Raja in London he reported back to Rosalind,  writing of Raja's cheerful spirits, ?(r)There's a briskness about him which  is nice.?А└ He also assured her that of all the dogs he encountered in the  park Coco was the aristocrat. And finally he promised that everything  would be all right and he would not be influenced then or later. He  wrote her a few paragraphs every day and mailed the letter after a  week or so, a pattern he would maintain in his absences for the next  fifteen years, though the absences would become more frequent and  longer. 
    Rosalind had asked Raja to trv to meet Lili Kraus and her husband  in Paris. Lili sent Rosalind her fresh and entirely innocent description  of this first meeting. 
    Darling Rosalind, 
    You must have served our Lord in many lives in many ways to 
    His great joy and satisfaction to have been granted the incomparable 
    privilege to share your life with two such creatures as Krishnamurti 
    and Rajagopal, a Saint and an Angel, a fighting angel at that. 
    Never will I forget this sign of true friendship and love which 
    enabled us to see ?(r)him' what must I call him, this pure light, this 
    heavenly serenity, this sweet child with the grace of a fairy prince, 
    the politeness of a knight; the wisdom of another, the only real 
    world; this diamond, flower, bird, butterfly Ал all in one; promise 
    226  
 
                         The Shadow Deepens 
    and fulfillment, all in one; this living miracle which goes among us  by the name of Krishnamurti? Do, darling Rosalind, tell Rajagopal,  when you write to him, our deepest thanks; do also tell him that  we found him so sweet in his fierceness! You see, by rights we had  no business to see K at all, as we had no permission of the police.  The airfield at Orly for transit flights is . . . a border only and  the passengers are not allowed to overstep it . . . Mme SuarАД|s had  permission and was therefore entitled to have tea with them in that  restaurant. But we couldn't get in there. So Rajagopal brought K in  to a ?(r)no man's land', which the police allowed us to enter too and  that's how we met. I am sure it wasn't at all easy for darling Raja to  arrange all that Ал and he was so sweet and angry because they made  such a fuss for really nothing. We saw them for about 15 minutes; an  unforgettable, incomprehensible eternity of keenest, rarest happiness,  indeed, there could not possibly have been a more auspicious, more  promising omen for our Ojai stay, for our association, than this  meeting. K spoke so warmly, tenderly about you and about our  future in our joint work at the school, as if he would have read my  own thoughts! 
    Darling Rosalind, thank you for your . . . settlement of the matter.  A rock rolled off our chests . . . You will be as happy when you hear  the piano as you can't possibly imagine! . . . 
    Love and all good wishes.  Ever,  LILI 
    While Krishna kept up his repeated reassurances to Rosalind from India,  we can infer?(r) from Raja's first letter, he had his own troubles. 
    Madras December 11, 1951  You must have had all the news from the usual Source about the  flight from London and what has been happening here since we  arrived on the 24th of November. Krishna had a slight fever but he  is all right now. I also had something or the other for a couple of  days . . . I saw Raja [Jinarajadasa] once or twice. He is quite cordial,  though seemed quite surprised that the Happy Valley Foundation is  still continuing and doing excellent work. He asked me a hundred  questions in a rather supercilious manner. I also saw Rukmini and her  Schools . . . I have seen my mother and family too. She has grown  very, very old, can't hear or see very well. Except generally in many  ways conditions here are worse than I imagined and I certainly feel 
    227      quite ?(r)lost'. T hope you are well and are taking good care of yourself 
    and not forgetting the promise to write or cable me should anything 
    turn out to be serious with you. 
    All my love, 
    RAJA 
    Ever since Krishna's defection from the Theosophical Society there  had been an estrangement between him and Jinarajadasa. While the two  Rajas had maintained their early affection, the politics involved caused  some strain. 
    Krishna meanwhile kept on with his daily letters to Rosalind, evi- dently confident that she was pacified and accepting his reassurances. He  said, ?(r)a molehill was made into a mountain and now even the molehill has  gone. Be assured everything is all right.?А└ He also commented on Raja's  talk with Jinarajadasa but left himself out of it. He said Jinarajadasa  was overly upset about things that happened twenty-five years ago and  should be more ready to forgive. 
    In the early 1930s, under the Star Publishing Trust, a substantial  house on six acres had been built for Krishna to stay in and to house the  work which continued even in his absence. The place was called Vasanta  Vihar and was across the river from the Theosophical Compound at  Adyar. Krishna would walk along the river in the evenings, on rare  occasions accompanied for a short distance by Raja. Continuing alone  beyond the Elphinstone Bridge toward the sea, Krishna avoided, with  great deliberation, setting foot in Adyar. He had sworn he would not  return there after Mrs Besant died. He made a continual issue of being  unwelcome and locked out from the apartments she had said were to  be his for life. 
    Raja did not share these sentiments and often went across to Adyar  for a pleasant evening with his friends or a musical performance.  Sitting home alone at Vasanta Vihar, Krishna faithfully reported all  this to Rosalind, adding cryptic comments about the lust for power in  the name of the Master, building schools and organizations, obvious  references to the Theosophical activities at Adyar. 
    Just before Christmas Raja had a letter from Rosalind telling him  that an examination had determined she needed major surgery. She  intended to go ahead without him or Krishna there. She wanted only  to have Erma and me with her. Raja and Krishna both reacted with  worry and solicitude about her health: 
    228  
 
                   
The Shadow Deepens 
    Darling Rosalind,  By the time this letter reaches you, you'll have been through it all 
    -and I shall be thinking of you, loving you, and praying for your  quick recovery & safe return home. So very sorry that this had to be  when [ am so far away Ал but everyone there near you, loves you &  would have done everything to make it all bearable and easy Ал Please  do not plunge back into school activities and worries.  All our love, Darling,  RAJA 
    Krishna's letters indicated that he had been given no advance warning  by Raja about the operation. Once he found out, he told Rosalind he had  sat all day and thought of her, loved her and, with Raja, prayed for her.  If all this were true one can visualize a rather touching scene of the two  men together on one side of the globe, drawn close in their common  concern for the woman they both loved on the opposite side. 
    In this same letter, Krishna allowed himself to be distracted from his  concern for Rosalind by his annoyance with her over an accusation she  had made. He objected to her use of the word, infatuated. regarding his  feeling for Nandini. Yet in an oblique way he admitted his attraction  by arguing that the word ?(r)infatuated' was still too strong. He claimed  it was only a flutter, if even that. But Rosalind would continue to have  unwitting indications from friends that he was lying to her sull. 
    Krishna portrayed to Rosalind an amiable and close relationship  between him and Raja; praising his work, his advice and showing con- cern for his occasional illnesses. He also expressed his irritation when  he felt Raja did something foolish like taking a hot bath and then sitting  under a fan. Of course, Krishna related, he got another cold. This cold  led to feverand several days in bed requiring Krishna's nursing. 
    In spite of Krishna's concern for Raja's health, as usual Raja cured  himself in his own way and not at all as Krishna would approve. Each  of them considered the other a bit foolhardy in their care of themselves.  And in their separation from Rosalind, both their bouts of illness became  more frequent. 
    Rosalind Darling, 
    I have not been able to write to vou during the past 3 weeks, as 
    I have been in bed with constant fever, not high, and a racking dryv 
    cough -& headache Ал K must have written whatever news there 
    has been. I have been thinking of you constantly and . . . T am suill 
    anxious.  
 
                   
 
    What about Lili Kraus Ал If you really think it wise & would like 
    to have her & her husband stay at A.V. with you, & thereby make 
    things easy for you in connection with your work, 1 won't be in 
    your way Ал I know you will do whatever you think best & wise, 
    especially knowing anything I have said or not said has been because 
    I have only thought ahead, of you & your welfare, about which you 
    have not yourself thought or considered, sufficiently or at all. 
    Dearest, take good care of yourself, you are a very precious person, 
    and you must get well for everybody's sake & especially for Radha's 
    & mine - 
   All my love to you, 
    RAJA 
    When Nandini and Pupul came to Madras, Krishna no longer tried  to keep their visits a secret from Rosalind. Instead, along with his  explanation that there was no more ?(r)flutter' at all, he enclosed a perfectly  circumspect note to him from Nandini requesting an interview. He  also stated that he had shown Raja the note and that Raja enjoyed  the company of the sisters and was the one who invited them often  to lunch and for evening outings. Krishna was starting to use Raja as  a blind, on one hand leading Rosalind to believe that it was Raja who  showed an interest in being with the sisters, when in fact Krishna made  arrangements for Raja to go somewhere with Pupul, leaving Nandini  behind. Raja was in an uncomfortable position, aware of what was  happening but unable, without showing indiscretion, to do anything  about it. 
    The situation became more uncomfortable for Raja in Bombay, where  he and Krishna stayed on their way to London. Here they were the guests  of Ratansi (the rich Indian with whom Nitya had once hoped to go into  business). Krishna continued to lay the blame for any contact with the  sisters on Raja. One day he arranged for Raja's absence from the house  by urging him to take a long and tiresome train journey to the outskirts  of Bombay to visit an old friend. Krishna wanted the field to be clear  for an important interview with Nandini's father-in-law, who wanted  him to persuade her to go back to her husband. Krishna reported this  to Rosalind and admitted that he had insisted Nandini be there too and  had then told her it was her life and not his and up to her to make up her  own mind. He closed the letter to Rosalind with the usual reassurances  of his love. 
    Raja wrote from London a week later. He was always extremely 
    careful about putting anything in writing, especially to Rosalind, whom 
    230  
 
                         The Shadow Deepens 
    he believed to be rather careless about leaving letters around. But when  he returned to Ojai we would hear how upset he had been by the  situation around Krishna, the way of life in India, so contrary to the  relatively austere and quiet years in Ojai. There had been devotees too  in QOjai, but not often in the house, and certainly not in Krishna's  bedroom, where in India they frequently gathered while he ate and  dressed. 
    Rosalind Darling, 
    [ hope you received the short note [ sent you from Bombay just  before we left. We have been staying quietly at Mrs Bindley's, she is  very kind, the house peaceful, & the food good. K gets just what he  wants & has been quite well. I want to be alone & quiet for a couple  of months & sort myself out, I need to badly after my visit to India 
    Ал can't write about all this to you & you will understand I am sure.  About July or so I shall slowly return to Ojai. K had better go to  Wrightwood for May & June, I think he ought to be quiet & alone,  & not get involved in Ojai activities. That's my feeling & you & he  will do whatever you think best Ал After July he may want to give a  few talks in Ojai before returning to India in September via Europe,  as he wants and plans to do.  [ hope you are better now tho' I hear you are again overdoing  school etc. Please, please take good care of yourself. At least you  won't have me round your neck in any way. 
    I was delighted to hear various accounts of your announcement of  Radha's engagement Ал Hope they are both really happy about it.  All my love, Darling,  RAJA  Please do-not leave my letters about. I feel nervous to write. 
    That February of 1952, Jimmy and I asked Rosalind to announce our  engagement at the school's Valentine party. My father had written to  me from London: 
    Dearest Radha, 
    .. . I shall write to him [Jimmy] soon and tell him how glad  am about him and you. It is good to hear that you feel right about  him and really happy . . . When are your exams? 
    Don't work too hard, just enough . . . unless you really enjoy  your studies. I only hope that you intend to complete college both  of you & get your degrees Ал you need not do brilliantly but it would 
    231  
 
                             be wise & good to finish what you have begun. [ hope Jim feels that  way too. Of course | am very happy about you, darling, and I love  you always very dearly . . .  All my love to you, darling  ) DADDY 
    Krinsh also gave his blessings, still addressing me as Kittums. He  said he was really so glad, very glad 2and happy about me and Jimmy  but it wasn't a great surprise for he had thought, all along, it would  be that way. 
    And I believe he really had from the very first. 
    With Raja's approval, Lili Kraus and her husband Otto Mandl had  been spending the past few months at Arya Vihara. Raja understood  how much this meant to Rosalind, even though he worried that as  always she was overdoing it. Krishna would not normally have minded  this arrangement, but he would later feel that Lili and Otto were part of  the obstacle to his returning which Rosalind unexpectedly raised. On  the grounds that her health was still not back to normal and that the  strain of closing the school for summer was very great, she asked that  he wait until June to return to Ojai. This had never happened before  and it evidently did not occur to Krishna that he himself might be the  cause of strain on her and that she wished to get through her school  year without this added burden. He acquiesced in her request but made  mournful allusions to the gloomy weather in London Ал that his hands  were so cold he could hardly write, and nostalgic allusions to California  in the spring, hoping she saw the beauty of Ojai and rejoiced. While  Krishna would never have stated any resentment about Lili being in  Arya Vihara, there is an occasional subtle reference to her presence  there and a hope that this was not the cause for Rosalind's fatigue.  Rosalind knew Krishna well enough Ал and he knew she did Ал to get the  message that he was unhappy at being kept away from Ojai, having to  walk round and round in a dreary little park (although there are larger  parks in London which are very beautiful in April) and go to boring  movies with Raja. He was distinctly out of sorts. 
    She suddenly changed her mind, relented, and as far as Krishna was  concerned everything was well again. The nearer the time came for  them to meet, the more loving his letters became and India and those  he had left there seemed to recede utterly from his thoughts, at least  those he expressed to Rosalind. 
    Once back in Ojai Krishna appeared to be quite charmed by Lili, as  indeed who would not be, and he even made a point of sitting in the 
    232  
 
                         The Shadow Deepens 
    patio when she practised the piano to show how much he enjoyed her  playing. 
    In addition to being one of the greatest pianists of our time, Lili was  one of the most extrordinary people we had met. She had an intense  beauty, and a vibrancy of spirit that not only flowed through her playing  but warmed all those in her presence, and this quality never diminished,  not even in her last days of life. 
    When the Japanese took Singapore and subsequently Java, Liii, her  husband and children were on a concert tour in the Dutch East Indies.  They were incarcerated in a prison camp for three years; for the first  year she and her husband were separated from the children. A vindictive  Dutch woman, threatened by severe beating for having had an affair  with a Japanese officer, declared that Lili was a spy, thus she was put  into the subterranean cells of the Kempe Tai, the equivalent force of  the Gestapo. 
    Dr Mandl forced his way seven or eight times to the offices of the  Kempe Tai, maintaining that whatever charges were to be made could  only concern him, since Lili was totally apolitical: an artist and a mother 
    -nothing else.  One of Lili's co-prisoners told her husband that the guards had  threatened to cut off her hands. Fortunately, just in time, the camp  was visited by a high-ranking officer who had once heard her play in  Tokyo. Not only did he avert this unspeakable tragedy, but he saw that  she had a piano and reunited the family, though he did not release them.  They lost almost everything material in the war, but Lili's existence was  not dependent on material things as she would prove. When she left  Ojai after her stay at Arya Vihara, Lili wrote to Rosalind: 
    You remember after having met Krishnaji and Rajagopal in Paris, I  wrote to you saying, how well you must have served the Lord to  be chosen as their life's companion. Having had the never fading  joy of living with you all these months I can understand so easily  why you should have been granted that privilege. 1 will not make  you blush and wince and wiggle by telling you of all the virtues  which make the very air round you sweet for me to breathe; let me  just tell this much, that in all hours, days, weeks we spent together  never once was my intention, taste, desire in discord with yours,  not on one single point. All you wanted, or did, or thought, or  felt, or planned I found good, right, reasonable, lovable in perfect  harmony with my reactions. So that now, being away I am there,  living in you, as it were, except, my poor sweet love, that all such 
    233  
 
                   
 
    burden, work, problems, difficulties as doubtless have to be coped  with are left for your shoulders to bear, like always. I only having  the picture of you living in Arya Vihara with beloved Krinsh and  beautiful, incomparable and ever unique-Coco . . . 
    I embrace and kiss you with all the tenderness and love of my  heart.  Ever,  LILI 
    And Lili's husband, Otto Mandl, also expressed his gratitude for their  stay 1n Qjai: 
    June 7th, ??52  My dear Friend Rosalind! 
    People tease me for being an optimist Ал But even so I had nearly  given up hope that in this hife of mine I would still be able to find  a place where I can put my roots in the ground . . . We both feel  without hesitation or doubt that we have found our home, our new  and lasting home in your nearness, whatever roof you may ultimately  choose for us in Ojai valley. The loving care you bestowed on us, the  full confidence and 1ts echo, the deep understanding you had for our  needs and wishes, this and much more for which I have no words  but an unfading memory, cannot have been a passing phase . . . 
    I will in London and Paris . . . search for every gleam of hope. for  a solution of the Famine problem which seems to worry Krishnaji  as it worries Aldous. Oh, I know only too well, how Krishnaji (I  hear his words, his very fiery voice) will say: ?(r)What is the use of all  your material remedies, your calculations, your statistics and your  planning, unless you can improve the heart of man?' Let me try just  the same, especially to improve my own mind, to see, think more  clearly, more lovingly, more detachedly. 
    One thing I found in your spiritual atmosphere, found it for the first  time in my old age: that the thirty or forty years, since my youth must  have made a rather bad old creature out of me Ал this I recognized one  morning, after having lived 3 weeks in Arya Vihara, when suddenly I  felt different, cleaner, unburdened, carefree, with a better conscience  toward my future; and like a revelation I knew: ?(r)That's how I always  felt when I was 16, 19, 25! had lost the memory of it and I must have  been sliding down away from the ?(r)Right Way' into an entanglement  of worries, of impatient efforts, of patching up weaknesses, of futile  vanities Ал and suddenly it seemed that fresh strength had been given 
    234  
 
                         The Shadow Deepens 
    me to start anew . . . to see once more with a clear mind, to strive  for truth, for unity with the universe, as I did 40 years ago.  [ had no intention to tell you this when I started the letter . . . It  may not be understandable to you, and still I would have hidden the 
    most important thing that happened between us, had I not mentioned  it. Yours with a happy heart,  OTTO 
    Lili and Otto were not the only ones to have these feelings about  Rosalind. Most people who came to Arya Vihara attributed the healing  atmosphere there solely to Krishna, but not all of them. Beato also,  would one day express her feelings about my mother. 
    As I think of friends who influenced my life, I know that your  mother has meant more to me than anyone else. I doubt ifI could  have hung on had I not met her, for I was in deep confusion, and  she lifted my orientation towards the spiritual life. Being near her  cured me of fanaticism and false worship where the higher life is  concerned, and though Krishnamurti's words meant a great deal to  me, [ understood more of what he said because she lived the actuality  of his thoughts. 
    It started sixty years ago at a party when I saw her glance at your  father with the most beautiful of smiles, as if the heavens opened and  there was no evil in the world, and that glow from her has remained  with me ever since. 
    There were times when in despair I went to her for comfort and her  presence clarified the problem and lifted me into another dimension  .. . My life has not only changed living near her, but in the darkness  that comes down at times on most of us, she has been the light.2 
    That light was in danger of dimming. Even as close a friend as Beato  could not see the cause of Rosalind's increasing unhappiness. It would  have been difficult for many people to accept that anyone living so close  to Krishna could have problems at all. Many years ago Raja had flinched  when a devotee had given him a vigorous handshake. ?(r)I have arthritis,'  he explained. ?(r)You have arthritis when you live so close to Him?!?А└ was  the incredulous response. 
    Raja returned early in July to California to find his immediate family  in a tailspin. Jimmy and I who had been engaged since February now  wanted, for a very good reason, to get married right away. Not yet 
    235  
 
                      knowing the story of my mother's secret pregnancies, I was surprised  to find that she took my news so hard. I looked forward most anxiously  to my father's arrival from Europe and my expectations were not in  vain. Raja was able to set aside his own worries enough to reassure  us that all he was concerned about was that we really loved each other  and wanted to marry. He would continue to support me through my  final year of college, as he was anxious that I should finish, and Jimmy's  father agreed to do the same for him so we had no immediate financial  problems. 
    Our wedding was a happy occasion. Both family and friends had long  felt that we were perfectly suited for each other and whatever tensions  hung about somehow floated away that day. Even Krinsh who, to my  knowledge, had never gone to anyone's wedding, was at ours and in  his most positive and beneficent mood. Perhaps his attitude about such  things had just mellowed, but he seemed genuinely happy about this  marriage. John Ingelman performed the service for he and Hilda had  been the first people to see me and I had always been exceptionally close  to them. Because John was a priest in the Liberal Catholic Church the  service would be that, as Rosalind's and Raja's had been in London, but  both Jimmy and I insisted on certain religious phrases being removed  which gave John considerable trouble with his bishop. 
    We honeymooned briefly in a charming cottage on the Santa Barbara  riviera, belonging to one of Krinsh's elderly spinster devotees. She had  offered the house to Rosalind and Krinsh for the summer. 
    Krishna still maintained his long-standing position of having no involve- ment with organizing or publishing his work. Raja had completed the  editing of the first book with Harper's, a slender volume, Education and  the Significance of Life, published in 1953, soon followed by The First and  Last Freedom, with a foreword by Aldous Huxley and then the three  volumes entitled Commentaries on Living. On these last, Raja finally  allowed the publishers to include his name as editor. Both Krishna's  notebooks and his verbatim talks needed meticulous and patient editing,  which Raja had spent most of his time doing for the past twenty-five  years. He had always kept himself in the background even though,  from the beginning, Krishna made it amply and frequently clear that  all publishing was entirely Raja's domain. Raja saw to the contracts and  had an excellent working relationship with the editors, a relationship  in which Krishna showed only the most cursory interest. He was to  reverse this position drastically.
