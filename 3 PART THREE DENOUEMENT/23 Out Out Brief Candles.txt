    There were endless discussions that summer about Lady Emily's book,  often in my presence, both in Carmel and Ojai. Like Raja, Rosalind felt  that it would be unfair to ask Lady Emily not to publish it, but Krinsh  had convinced her that the role she played in the ?(r)process' incident, as  described by Nitya, because of her connection to the school, would  bring undesirable publicity to it. She suggested her name could be left  out, but saw no reason to stop the book. Publication was scheduled for  the autumn and Raja had been sent a next-to-final set of page proofs. 
    Seeing the manuscript in this format seemed to snap Krishna out  of his detachment. He became actively opposed to publication at all,  which surprised both Rosalind and Raja. Krishna insisted on writing  his decision to Lady Emily, leaving no room for doubt as to his  objections. She cabled back in distress, explaining the intolerable cost  of withdrawal at this point and expressing shock at what she saw as  his sudden volte face. Krishna persisted with his conviction that the  book would do untold damage to him and his work and that no other  consideration was important. Lady Emily and Mary found this demand  so inconsistent with Krishna's attitude in London that they suspected it  was Raja's influence which had wrought the change. This was totally  erroneous and one more example of an inability in many people to place  responsibility on Krishna for those actions they saw as less than perfect.  Krishna could be extremely positive if not downright stubborn when  he wished to be, a side of himself that he rarely displayed. If Mary and  Lady Emily failed to get this impression in London, they are certainly  not to blame. The intentional vagueness that Krishna wielded as detached  influence too often caused confusion. 
    Raja disapproved of KWinc funds being used as financial recompense  for the d°ß|bicle, reasoning that money collected for Krishna's work could  not ethically be used for such a purpose. Neither was he in agreement  with Krishna's attitude, but felt it was Krishna's responsiblity to work  it out with Lady Emily. Krishna magnanimously offered to pay off  the cancellation costs in monthly instalments out of his allowance from

    ~ Miss Dodge's trust. But Lady Emily declined to accept. Her family  ~ shouldered the financial burden alone. According to Mary the whole  ~incident added ten years to her mother's appearance. 
    -Towards Rosalind Krishna took on the role of a protective knight,  assuring her repeatedly while in Ojai, and later that autumn in his letters  from London, that he had done all this for her and that he would continue  to see that everything was right between them. He was more ardent  than ever in his pleas that nothing would ever come between them  and that what they had together was more important than anything.  He promised to make no more mistakes, to do no more thoughtless  things and that there was no diminishing of his love.  He ignored the fact that Rosalind did not feel very strongly one way or  the other about Candles, not even in so far as it affected her. He seemed  to feel that the whole incident had drawn them closer, perhaps because  he was for once in a position to protect her and to make her aware  of it. Perhaps he was also anxious, because of Nandini, that the first  occurrence of the ?(r)process', with Rosalind in 1922, be kept private. 
    Krishna must have sensed that Raja was withdrawing from him. The  controversy with Lady Emily had left new wounds between them,  wounds unheeded for the time being but which would flare up in the  near future. 
    Back in London, Krishna did his best to comfort Lady Emily -to  the degree that once again she got the impression that he would not  have minded all that much if her book were after all published. But  on the same day that this meeting took place he wrote to Rosalind that  Candles would definitely not be published ever and that he had told Lady  Emily she must accept his decision, even to the extent of putting in her  will that 1t would never happen! 
    Did Krishna himself believe he had settled the matter with Lady  Emily in the way he described to Rosalind? Would Lady Emily have  been shocked to have seen how casually, in his letter to Rosalind, he  treated her distress, always confident that he could sway her to his point  of view? Or was he aware of his inability to face any unplesantness; to  offer a straightforward ?(r)No' face to face? Lady Emily was not as taken  in as Krishna might have imagined. She may have been powerless to  take a stand against him, but she could be very clear-sighted. One day  she would write to Raja: ?°„You have been the lamb on Krishna's altar.' 
    -Before she died she went even further. She said she knew Krishna was  a congenital liar but that she would nevertheless always adore him.  249
