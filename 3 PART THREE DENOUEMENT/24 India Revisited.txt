    India Revisited 
    For the past few years some of the happiest moments between Rosalind  and Krishna had revolved around Coco, the exceptionally intelligent  poodle which had come into their lives in her full maturity. Both  Krishna and Raja understood that the way to Rosalind's heart was  through her dog and in their letters they seldom failed to refer to Coco  with great affection. What Rosalind considered to be a love match had  occurred between Coco and a beautiful black poodle belonging to the  opera singer, Lotte Lehmann. The expectation of puppies had created  almost as much ofa flurry as Lady Emily's book and Krishna was deeply  disappointed that he must leave Ojai before their birth. His letters to  Rosalind from London and later from India were full of advice and  reminders for the care of the pregnant dog. Then in February 1955 he  received the following letter. 
    Dear Krishnaji:  We have for you $1000.00 to be given to the Rishi Valley School. You  may wonder how [ am able to send you this amount. Will you please  tell the children in your school that I sold my children to raise the  money to give you as a token of my regard for you and for all you have  done for me such as walking, brushing, feeding and understanding  me. I think [ must correct the statement that all the money was given  for my puppies. There were actually some people who gave money  NOT to have a puppy! This I know you will find hard to understand  as [ do. Hardly anyone could see my beautiful black puppies without  longing for one. We have arranged it so you will see one when next  you are here, and you can even have one of my grandchildren. 
    With a heart full of love as always,  coco [signed with an inked paw mark] 
    Krishna attributed both the letter and its sentiments to Rosalind. His  reply makes clear how deeply touched he was by her generosity to his  school and he closed the letter by telling her he loved her very much.  (Coco received no credit at all.)

    Rosalind's dear friend Maria Huxley, died that same month. No one,  most of all Aldous, had realized how ill Maria was. She had brought  Aldous to visit us in Berkeley not long before and had even then  been on radiation treatments for cancer, which she most ill advisedly  suspended to take that trip. Her spirit masked whatever misery she  was undergoing until the very end. For Aldous's sake, she insisted  that everything be as usual. Rosalind had helped to bring Maria home  from the hospital two weeks before she died and had remained as close  to her as she could. After the funeral Aldous asked most unexpectedly  if he could come right up to Arya Vihara. Being with him those few  days was my first confrontation with such intense grief. We all, even  my mother, felt absolutely helpless in the face of it. 
    Although Raja accompanied Krishna to Australia in 1955, he had no  desire to return to India. At Ojai he could live his own rather hermitic  life and go about his work without undue exposure to the annoying  aura of devotion that Krishna appeared to encourage in the country  of his birth. Rosalind, however, wished to see for herself the scene  around Krishna in India and once and for all sort out her feelings.  She left the Happy Valley School in the hands of her trusted Assistant  Director and flew to Australia to meet Krishna, while Raja returned  to Ojai. 
    She had not travelled abroad with Krishna since the 1930s. She had  forgotten what to expect. There was a large crowd to see them off from  Sydney, another to greet them in Djakarta during their brief layover to  Singapore; nothing of course like in his Theosophical era, but so much  more than in California. Fortunately at Singapore there was no reception  committee. They stayed at Raffles Hotel and were able for one day to be  ordinary tourists. At first Krishna balked at the idea of sightseeing but  ended up enjoying it thoroughly, like a small boy who had discovered  a new game. 
    Rosalind's diary for those six months indicates that she had a very  interesting time, on which she reported at length for the benefit of the  school children back in Ojai. At Benares they were met by a crowd  from the school at Rajghat and taken to a beautiful house by the river.  It seems they were plunged right off into the school problems, to quote  from Rosalind's diary. 
    Tues. Dec 6: Foundation talk, Rao upset, all upset, crisis for Foun- dation members to know what to do.  Wed. Dec 7: Foundation meeting. Gurtugi suggests closing upper  schools.  
 
                      On these visits to Krishna's school she was often appealed to by the  staff to help clarify what Krishna was saying and what he expected  of them. She had behind her nearly ten years' experience in directing  a school and was well aware of the psychological as well as of the  practical problems. On the one hand Krishna would ask her to help,  but he was impatient about her criticism of his habit of favouritism  and his failure to acknowledge the honest efforts of those who were  really keeping the school together. Rosalind could see that everyone in  the school hung on his every word, although Krishna often criticized  the staff for failing to understand his teachings. 
    In Delhi Krishna and Rosalind stayed with Shiva Rao and his Austrian  wife Kitty. Shiva Rao, an early tutor of Krishna's at Adyar and Raja's  first tutor in Benares, had remained a lifelong friend of them both.  Rosalind also met many of Krishna's devotees and friends. She picked  up subtle innuendoes about the Mehta divorce incident but could divine  no actual facts. More and more, however, she sensed that Krishna had  been far from truthful with her. In addition to her personal hurt she  was concerned that Krishna might continue to be involved in scandalous  repercussions, but no amount of discussion with him would clarify the  issue for her. 
    In Delhi, Rosalind coaxed Krishna to go with her to visit Humayan's  tomb and the Qutub Minar. In a letter to Rosalind a few weeks later from  Madras, where Krishna had gone ahead, he told her it had been a beauti- ful day Ал he was glad they went together. And he added, as soon as she  saw all she wanted to see, he hoped she would hurry down to Madras and  they would again be together. He might have sensed that he was about  to become ill. By the time Rosalind arrived in Madras, Krishna was very  ill indeed. His talks had to be cancelled; Madhavachari was alarmed and  grateful that she was there to take over nursing him. This kind man who  was in charge of Krishna's household, talks, travels and general welfare  in India was almost in tears with frustration and anxiety for Krishna  was a difficult patient. Poor Madhavachari could not have foreseen the  future times he would be left with an ill Krishna. Rosalind developed a  great fondness for him during this stay. Later it upset her to see that,  while Krishna always went first class, usually by plane, Madhavachan  spent days on buses and overcrowded trains to save funds. 
    Rosalind found brief occasions while nursing Krishna to visit Raja's  family. His mother was very touched that her American daughter-in- law turned up every day with a lotus blossom and played with her  great-grandchildren. 
    When Krishna was well, he and Rosalind went to Rishi Valley for  
 
                         India Revisited 
    the month of February. There they encountered many of the same  problems as at Rajghat. There were teachers' meetings, discussions, or  Krishna's talks every day. Among others who complained to her was  Krishna's nephew, for whom Krishna had found work at the school  but who was not fitting in well with the others. There were charges  of nepotism. Eventually, this nephew would become the principal. 
    March was spent in Bombay, again with discussions or public talks  every day. Here, as had Raja, she found the numbers of devotees around  Krishna both surprising and disturbing and got the impression that he  did nothing to discourage it. She could not comprehend how Krishna  could put up with this intimate idolatry while he ate his breakfast,  dressed, and then had interviews or meetings before lunch. In Ojai he  was so protective of his privacy. In spite of his attendants in Bombay  he found time and oppeortunity not only to express his physical love  for Rosalind, but also to arrange for his friends to take her shopping  and sightseeing. He seemed most anxious that she enjoy this time in  India in every way possible. 
    Rosalind had hoped that she would be able to meet Nandini and to feel  out for herself exactly what the situation was. However, Krishna told her  that Nandini was in samadhi (that cxalted and egoless state of liberation  in which Krishna himself had claimed to be long ago in Ojai), although  she believed Krishna had deliberately arranged Nandini's inaccessibility. 
    Friends had planned a day's trip by plane to see the Ajanta and  Ellora caves. Rosalind had come down with a cold. Krishna felt they  should cancel the trip. But she was reluctant to cancel such elaborately  made plans and insisted on going, accompanied by two friends and a  somewhat reluctant Krishna. In the small unpressurized plane Rosalind  suffered excruciating pain in her.ear and was to learn later that her  eardrum had burst. It was an altogether unpleasant day. The happy  moments they had shared in the early weeks of this journey, sightseeing  and revisiting old haunts, suddenly seemed very distant. 
    Just before leaving Bombay, however, Rosalind did have one brief 
    meeting with Nandini at one of Krishna's public talks. Rosalind sensed 
    a reserve in her that could have been no more than natural shyness. 
    Krishna deftly avoided giving them an opportunity to talk. Rosalind 
    realized the tension that Krishna felt trying to keep his two lives 
    apart. Yet the hospitality shown her by Nandini's sister Pupul, and 
    the brief moment with Nandini herself confirmed Rosalind's belief 
    that Krishna's ?(r)infatuation' had not been reciprocated. She had always 
    regarded Nandini as an innocent figure in Krishna's deception. She 
    could understand Krishna's attraction for this woman who was in 
    253  
 
                   
 
    many ways an ideal Indian beauty. She realized also that the nature  of his relationship with Nandini, whatever it might be, was, to her, of  secondary importance. It was what Krishna felt in his heart as opposed  to what Rosalind considered the untruthful insistence that he loved only  her that she found unbearable. Her repeated confrontations begging him  to admit that their relationship was over and that he was interested in  someone else were futile and met only with stony silence on his part. 
    On the whole Rosalind had been happy on this trip, for she loved  India. But good as Krishna had been to her there, she was deeply  disturbed by the contradictions in his life: the devotees and adulation  which he appeared to enjoy on one side of the globe while decrying  them on the other. 
    When Krishna and Rosalind arrived in Rome they were virtually  penniless. Raja had failed to get the money there for them that they  had expected. They were met by an old friend, Vanda Scaravelli, with  whom they both stayed. Thus the situation was not grave, as Raja  rcalized. but this oversight would be the beginning of much future  conflict between Krishna and Raja. 
    Raja had always been the one to see to all the tiresome details in our  lives. When Krishna and Rosalind had a ?(r)bright idea' it was Raja who  had to implement it Ал arrange to buy the car, the cabin, the sending  of money to Krishna's schools and relatives in India. He had disliked  being referred to as Krishna's secretary or manager. He felt his true  responsibilities lay in the editing and publication of the teachings, the  organization necessary for travels and, along with Rosalind, seeing to  the well-being of Krishna. Raja's education would have enabled him to  have many careers, from professor at a university, to law or politics.  Neither he nor Rosalind had ever been devotees. They had both always  been scrupulously careful not to interfere in Krishna's inner life. They  tried to arrange for him the solitude and the simplicity of life that they  had always understood from him to be his requirement. 
    During the best of their times together Krishna appreciated this  arrangement. He depended heavily on Raja's judgment, not only in  practical matters but also for his advice in the projection of his teachings.  On many mornings before his Sunday talks, he would appear at Raja's  door. They would spend a half-hour going over the questions that had  been sent to him. He seemed to find, in Raja's presence, a reassurance  that the words would come at the right moment. He used to describe  to me his fear that one day he would sit there in silence before the  audience with his mind empty. He never wanted to be with anyone  but my father before the talks.

    Leaving Krishna in Rome, Rosalind went to Paris for a week by  herself. Krishna wrote her a long letter summing up the past six months  together which he said, with a few exceptions, had been good. He said  it had been beneficial for her to see the many beautiful things she had  seen and the different cultures, as if she were a schoolgirl who had never  seen such things before. Again he implored her not to let superficial  agitation and emotionalism disturb the deep inner understanding and  love that was between them. But he misjudged the change of heart  that had finally taken place in Rosalind. 
    She met both Krishna and Raja in Stockholm. Here one day walking  alone with Raja by a canal, she told him that she did not want Krishna to  return to America. She wanted to be completely free of him, for a while  atleast. Her school work demanded she remain in Ojai, but Krishna could  live elsewhere just as well. Her emotions, which had been ricocheting  for the past five years between her lingering love for Krishna and her  increasing suspicions of his feelings, finally pushed her into throwing  out this bombshell, which much later even she would see as irrational  and somewhat outrageous. Perhaps she was moved by an increasing con- sciousness of her own individuality, now that she had a separate life with  the school. Perhaps part of the cause was her discomfort in continuing to  live a secret life with Krishna while taking on a role which demanded a  new concern for reputation. Before the school she had seen discretion as  a necessity for Krishna rather than herself. Besides it is one thing to take  risks for a happy love affair and quite another for one that is faltering. 
    Raja was caught in this conflict. It involved him, of course, as long as  he was connected with Krishna. He felt Rosalind was being unreasonable  in her demand, even though he understood her emotional state. But  surprisingly Krishna agreed not to return to California. 
    Howevet co-operative Krishna appeared to be at the time, there  would be later repercussions that would fall on Raja's rather than on  Rosalind's head. But judging from Krishna's letters to her immediately  after, when she had returned to California, one wonders if he had taken  Rosalind seriously at all or if he were just certain this mood would  pass and that the love between them was ultimately inviolable. He  wrote as though nothing had changed, asked after Coco, the school,  and imagining how happy and excited everyone must have been on  her return. He repeatedly assured her that she had his love as always  and that only when one has lost love do things go wrong. 
    Mr Robbie died in Ojai that June of 1956. He was eighty-two and had  suffered several strokes. He had wanted to go for a long time. One

    afternoon at his weekly tea party under the pergola behind Saro Vihara  my mother was trying to cheer him by getting him to recite poetry.  She said, how wonderful it must be to have so many beautiful verses  in his head. He replied, nothing mattered any more, that he had been  waiting ever since Sara died to die himself. It was difficult for Rosalind  to be philosophical about Mr Robbie's death. It was a great loss. 
    Robert had left Rosalind enough of his estate to make her financially  independent for life. This was something Sara and he had agreed to do  years before, but it was unexpected and unlooked for by Rosalind.
