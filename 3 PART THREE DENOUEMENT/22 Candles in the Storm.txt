    Candles in the Storm 
    As he had promised, Raja returned to California in time for my  graduation from Scripps College and Jimmy's graduation from Pomona  in June 1953. The two colleges were adjacent and we had lived for the  past year in a small apartment in Claremont. In July we moved with our  baby, Catherine Anjali, to northern California, where Jimmy worked  as a physicist at the Atomic Energy Commission for a year before we  both went on to graduate school at Berkeley. 
    There was also another change in the family: Louis Zalk's wife had  recently died and Erma and Louis were married that summer of 1953.  They were 1n their late sixties and were to enjoy ten years of happily  married life. We would remain very close to them both. Louis had  always been a strong presence in our lives and his devotion to both  Krishna and Raja had been steadfast. 
    Rosalind had been offered a house on the south edge of Point Lobos  in the Carmel Highlands, and she and Krinsh spent a good part of that  summer there, with us joining them on weekends. 
    At fifty-eight, Krishna still wanted the same physical relationship  with Rosalind that had started twenty years before and which, in spite  of the recent contentiousness between them, had not, as Raja believed,  yet terminated. The house on Point Lobos stood in isolated scenic  beauty, opening on to the State Park and hanging over a churning  sea below. The bark of sea-lions was constant above the waves and  the tide pools harboured an array of exquisite sea creatures. Except for  our visits on the weekends, there was every opportunity for intimacy.  On Rosalind's side, their relationship had become a habit like the habit  of a marriage that is no longer good but not bad enough to struggle  through an ending. But at times like this, away from the pressures  of the school, she still felt resurrectional sparks of their old love and  Krishna made every effort to fan these embers. He acted toward me as  he always had and assumed a grandfatherly role toward Tinka (as we had  nicknamed our baby). He was pleased that her middle name was Anjalj,  my father's suggestion, and explained that it meant in Sanskrit literally

    ' the space between the hands when held together in greeting, or infinite  peace. I felt at times that we were once again the family we had always  been, which expanded under the same tension to incorporate my father  on his infrequent appearances. While Raja and Rosalind expressed deep  affection towards each other in their letters, their personalities caused  conflict in direct communion, exacerbated by the presence of Krinsh,  who often went back and forth between them like a child intent on  dividing and ruling. Ostensibly trying to make peace, the comments  he repeated and the tales he told inevitably led to worse arguments.  My father's disposition became more and more irascible and even his  close friends began to wonder at this change, making it all the easier  for Krishna in the near future to draw on their sympathy.  Krishna and Raja left again for Europe and India in the autumn.  Krishna's letters began to express a more philosophical tone than they  had in the past, but he still included his declarations of love. He entreated  Rosalind to remain open to everything, including their love and to feel  their closeness.  Raja was busy in Europe arranging foreign translations and copy- rights, and meeting with the editor from Harper's, who was in Rome.  Krishna joined them in a tour of the Vatican and cxpressed to Rosalind  his approval of Raja's efforts. For some time he would continue, in small  ways, to assure Rosalind of this approval of Raja, just as he assured her  of his love for her, as if he were anxious to maintain a status quo, to keep  their relationships and their lives as they had always been. Sometimes  he seemed to be chiding her, saying it was thoughtless and destructive  to obscure their love by their behaviour.  Lady Emily had asked Raja to come and see her about a book she had  written, but both his health, his own involvement in publishing, and  an instinct that this was going to be a sticky matter, led him to defer  this interview and he and Krishna went off to India without fulfilling  her request. Krishna, however, wrote and asked that he and Raja could  see the book before it went to press. Lady Emily took the trouble to  send her manuscript to Madras with the hope that they would return  it as soon as possible. She had a publisher and was naturally anxious to  proceed. Krishna refused to look at the manuscript carefully, although  he glanced at it peripherally and indicated to Raja that it should not be  published.  Raja, who read it thoroughly, thought this was unfair to Lady Emily,  that there were things in it that could be deleted to spare various people's 
    -feelings but that it was an important record of Krishna's development  at a crucial era in his life, as well as the historical events around the  243  
 
                   
 
    Theosophical Society. However, he felt his suggestions would be too  involved to handle by correspondence and urged Lady Emily to hold  up publication until they could all discuss it together. 
    Raja had the added complication of explaining Krishna's attitude, for  Krishna refused to do this himself. It was clear that Krishna didn't  want it published at all, but he would not be pinned down, claiming  he had not read it, though he had obviously read enough to draw  a negative conclusion. What had struck him was the inclusion of his  experience under the pepper tree in Ojai. Lady Emily had been one  of the privileged few to receive the full account typed by Raja in 1923  and she had included that in her book as well as many letters to her  from Krishna, revealing his innermost thoughts about Theosophy, his  protectors and other relationships. 
    In 1953, Krishna was as adamantly opposed to many Theosophists  and their views, as he had been when he broke with the society. He  had no wish to be reminded, or to have his public reminded, of his  origins in the Theosophical Society. All this Raja understood Ал and he  sympathized with much of it. He felt, however, that the book could be  satisfactorily edited. He also felt that Krishna must speak for himself  and directly to Lady Emily. Meanwhile Lady Emily was left hanging  with the clear impression that Krishna was too tired to read her book  and would let her know about it later. Raja had made the mistake of  protecting Krishna by excusing the delay because of Krishna's fatigue.  Much as Nitya had suffered over Krishna's treatment of Mrs Besant,  Raja began to imagine the same situation for himself evolving around  Lady Emily's book. He tried to get Krishna to take a clear stand. But  Krishna characteristically insisted that he would neither approve nor  disapprove, that Lady Emily must come to the right decision herself.  In addition to this issue, which Raja correctly foresaw was to bring  grief all around, the trouble with his oesophagus flared up again. 
    Life in India was complex for him emotionally. He was often caught  between Krishna's new affections and enthusiasms and the consequent  appearance of disinterest toward his old workers, who had devoted  years to helping him. Krishna had always needed the association with  famous, well-to-do and colourful people, while Raja was content to  build his friendships among those who were loyal and conscientious  and with whom he had a good working relationship; not very exciting,  but he had never sought excitement or outward stimulation. There were  the inevitable bruised feelings and rivalries endemic in most ?(r)spiritual'  circles. When Raja had believed he and Krishna and Rosalind stood  together on a solid base of commitment to a way of life, it had 
    244  
 
                         Candles in the Storm 
    been easier to cope with outside personality problems. His letters to  Rosalind, only hint at the increasing depression which was soon to  consume him. 
    Darling Rosalind, 
    It has not been possible or easy for me to write often; my life in India  these few months has been an exact repetition of last year's, nothing  whatsoever new, same everything including the problems, but I have  thought and thought of you, and you will have known that. 
    Unlike Rosalind, he could not and would not walk away from  problems or pretend they did not exist. He was still determined to  carry the responsibilities he had assumed nearly thirty years before.  Nevertheless, he was feeling the need to withdraw from a close asso- ciation with Krishna, although at this point their lives were still tightly  bound together. 
    Rosalind too was undergoing some basic changes. More and more  the school was absorbing her attention and becoming her whole life.  Her energy, which had been severely tested during the war, had not  regained its high level. Yet it was still vital. When Krishna and Raja  were in Ojal, or when Jimmy and [ came to visit, her outward activity  was the same. She still ran the houschold herself, cooking meals at either  end ofa long day at school. Her focus, however, was obviously on her  work. Her thoughts, as reflected in her conversations, were all related  to the school. Her close friends like Lili noticed the change. 
    Today 1s the 24th of December  & it is the first free hour in which, at long last, I can go on with  this letter . . . but I will never be able to say with words all that  is in my heart. I am longing for you with soul and spirit; I already  missed you grievously during our last stay in the Ojai. Somehow  there was never time enough for the sweet, peaceful relationship; for  the exchange of thoughts, ideas; for the beholding of the other's being  in wishless, grateful wonder ofa fulfilled friendship as it all happened  in that unforgettable first sejour of ours in your house. But flowers  do blossom differently every year &, as Goethe said ?(r)and, oh, you  will not swim in the same river for the second time'. But the river  is all there, lovely & mighty, but changed, with new waters running  through its bed. And you are there too, in the old-new sameness Ал  & all this is as it should be . . . ever yours, 
    LILI

                      In Madras, Krishna was still taking his walks, gazing across the Adyar  river at the Theosophical land where he had once been happy and which  he was told was still beautiful. He would not break his resolution to never  set foot there, but Theosophists came to his talks and he commented to  Rosalind that they are not a thoughtful breed. 
    He wrote her repeated warnings about certain Theosophical Society  members who had come to Ojai and were involved in the Happy Valley  School. He was adamant that their influence should not enter into the  school. He repeatedly insisted that she must speak in the assemblies and  keep a tight rein on the general atmosphere, to create the right feeling  of oneness and not leave it to others to interpret. No one reading his  letters could doubt that he had a strong interest in the school, but just  how strong was not yet clear. He evidently felt confident that Rosalind  would transmit, without conscious effort, his ideas. He had insisted  from the start that he wanted no official connection with the school.  It would become clear in the future that he assumed he would have a  pipeline to it through Rosalind. 
    In March 1954, Jimmy and I had our second and last child, whom  we named Robert after Mr Robbie. My father found a moment of  happiness in this news, writing to us from Athens, 
    Dearest Radha & Jimmy, 
    The day I received the news about Baby Robert I went to the 
    Acropolis by myself and sat at the Parthenon and thought of you 
    and Mummy and the newborn, and sent you from there all my 
    love and blessings Ал It was such a lovely coincidence that I could 
    be at the Parthenon that day ~ you can have no idea, till you see it, 
    how beautiful it is Ал not only that but the Acropolis & all around it 
    the sea Ал 
    I am sure that one day you will come here & see it all Ал That at 
    least was what I wished when I had just heard of my dear new friend 
    Baby Robert. 
    It is good that all has gone well, darling & I hope you are very 
    happy. Please send me a snapshot of the baby & also of Tinka. 
    All my love to you Four, 
    DADDY 
    In Athens, the problem of Lady Emily's book was finally confronted,  at least to some degree, by Krishna. He still refrained from making a  positive statement about whether it should or should not be published.  He used on Lady Emily and her daughter, Mary, very much the same 
    246  
 
                         Candles in the Storm 
    technique he used in his lectures and discussions: to lead his listeners  to his view while making them feel they were finding their own path.  They were to be open, drop their preconceptions and their desires,  and experience what he was saying. This procedure had mixed success  when working with abstractions. It was totally disastrous when applied  to anything so concrete as a book. He admitted now that he had read it  very carefully, that it read very well. Only in talking it over together  could a right decision be reached as to whether it should or should not  be published, and that decision would not be his. 
    Raja had hoped that if he kept his opinions to himself Krishna would  be forced to come to his own decision and make his opinion clear to  Lady Emily. He soon saw that this hope was in vain. When they arrived  in London, Krishna was reluctant to discuss the book at all and brought  up no objections whatever with Lady Emily. He did show an interest  and enthusiasm for the title, Candles in the Sun, the sun being the World  Teacher in whose light all the candles (those who awaited his coming)  were dimmed. This single approbation led Lady Emily and Mary to  assume there were no further objections and they procceded with the  publication Ал little realizing that the storm had just begun.
