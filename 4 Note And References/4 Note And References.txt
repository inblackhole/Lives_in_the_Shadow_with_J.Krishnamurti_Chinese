    1 The Elders  1 Kandinsky and Mondrian and other early abstract painters found  inspiration in Leadbeater's writing. Indeed, one artist evidently received  a mysterious transmission of Leadbeater's ?(r)thought forms', which he  then painted. A recent retrospective at the Los Angeles County Art  Museum, titled, ?(r)The Spiritual In Art. . .' contained numerous examples  of art works manifesting the influence of Leadbeater and Theosophy.  2 For this version of the story, well known among Theosophists, I am  indebted to Gregory Tillett, The Elder Brother: A Biography of Charles  Webster Leadbeater (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1982), pp. 12-14.

    10 Bypassing the Masters  1 The study of dissociated or disintegrated personalities dates from the  late nineteenth century and Mrs Besant was undoubtedly familiar with  these theses.

    28 A New Circle in the Shadow  1 Rosalind was referring to the following passage in Nethercot's biog- raphy of Annie Besant, reflecting his perplexity about Krishnamurti,  the man: 
    Here then is an extraordinary case of a man who, after a long and  bizarre struggle with life, has finally got himself and his mind under  almost complete control °– has perhaps hypnotised himself so that  he can relegate to oblivion most of the things he does not want  to remember, because they recall the unhappy days when he was  becoming an individual and was escaping from the domination of 
    327  
 
                   
 
    others whom he had cause to love and admire. One of his favorite  discussion topics is that of ?(r)exploitation', by which he means the  influence on one human being by another to bring the other round  to one's own point of view in order to use that individual for one's  own purpose. When, however, I temerariously suggested that perhaps  he might have been ?(r)exploited' by Annie Besant in that sense, he flared  up in what I would have called an angry denial in any less philosophic  a person than he. I should hate to think of him as a charlatan; I prefer  to think of him as a sort of schizophrenic, or at least a man ofa now  permanently divided personality.

    ?°„Sloss's achievement in Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti is to have  him interesting without embalming him in flattery; she is able to do this at  partly because she grew up in his menage in California's Ojai valley, so she s  him every day at his most ordinary. She brings us insights and information t  help to flesh out someone who has been projected as a spiritual skeleton by te  many biographies....Without ever losing sight of her huge affection for her s ;  ject, Sloss is able to look bevond the myth.?°¿
