 19 A School is Born 
    When, in 1927, Mrs Besant had bought the Happy Valley land and  entrusted it to the Happy Valley Foundation, whose members she  had chosen, she told them they had centuries in which to work.  By extending her vision over such a long range she alleviated the  impatience that might have arisen in her trustees to see instant marvels  arising in Happy Valley. This, however, did not alleviate the problem  of meeting the annual payments on the $90,000 mortgage with which  the property was encumbered. That onerous duty fell largely on the  Logans and Louis Zalk. They issued regular appeals for pledges to  help clear title. Those loyal to Mrs Besant, those who shared in her  vision of the coming sixth sub-root race, answered the call for help  until the Great Depression fell upon the world. Then the Logans and  Louis Zalk were left with a considerable financial problem, for they  also were affected by the crash. For the next twenty-five years there  would be a running correspondence between Robert and Louis about  their joint responsibility. This exchange began in Robert's usual wry  tone in October 1930. 
    Dear Louis, 
    Of course I will help you out as you request but really I do not 
    quite understand what the situation will be, to whom payments will 
    be made and by whom records kept and receipts sent. 
    Enlighten me a little in words of one syllable . . . I remember we 
    had a meeting . . . at which everybody was elected trustee and then 
    immediately resigned and was replaced by everybody else. 
    . . . believe me, with all good wishes, 
    Faithfully, 
    ROBERT 
    This tone of informality should not belie the competence and dedi- cation of these two men in their efforts to bring to fruition Mrs Besant's  vision. Had they not believed so firmly in that, they would have found 
    201  
 
                   
 
    the task too trying. The only source of income on the land was a walnut  grove which sometimes helped to pay the taxes and mortgage and was  managed by a tenant farmer, the original owner of the land. There was  a steady stream of people, mostly Theosophists, who hoped themselves  to be a part of the new sixth sub-root race or at least wanted to be there  ready to welcome it. Fielding these inquiries was a duty which fell to  Robert. 
    June 22, 1935  Dear Louis,  I quite agree with your letter about not considering any colonizing 
    plans until we can hold a real meeting of the trustees.  As I have had to answer a good many criticisms and enquiries  lately . . . I inclose copies . . . of some of my answers for your  comments. 
    Dear Kahuna, 
    As for starting colonization, there is certainly no ?(r)no Theosophist  need apply' attitude on the part of the trustees; there is only . . . a  desire to be very sure of not making some wrong venture when the  land is still under a substantial mortgage. A failure now would make  it almost impossible ever to get the mortgage paid off or reduced to  safe proportions . . . meanwhile it could do no harm to submit to  Louis Zalk some practical plans and suggestions toward first steps  in colonization. 
    Dear Mrs S 
    You are quite at liberty to change your pledge or cancel it altogether  .. . As for the colonization of Happy Valley, the trustees have no  other thought in mind and would certainly not have made all the  efforts they have had to make for seven years to reduce the heavy  mortgage from $90,000 to 843,000 if they had not been dedicated to  the ultimate accomplishment of Dr Besant's intentions. 
    T.S. members are sometimes too ready to criticize each other's  efforts without a clear understanding of the facts and I hope when  vou hear further criticism of the Happy Valley Foundation . . . you  will ask the critics to send in some helpful suggestions instead.  By 1941, the Happy Valley situation was basically unchanged except  that the mortgage was being reduced and the land therefore still intact.  There were still as many ideas as to what the land should be used for 
    202  
 
                         A School is Born 
    and who should do the using as there were people, both within the  foundation and on the outskirts ~ to say nothing of the ?(r)fringe'. 
    There was also a claim (later proved to be unfounded) by a Theo- sophical member against Happy Valley for a school in lieu ofa former  loan, about which Robert commented: 
    September 12, 1943  Dear Louis, 
    If Miss S. should depart for Shamballa [the home of the king of  the occult hierarchy believed to be located in the Gobi desert] before  the time comes either to found a school or repay the money, there  would probably be no controversy at all; . . . it all seems to rest on  Dr Besant's two letters and the minutes of the Happy Valley. 
    ... To my mind it is not so much a question whether or not we  are trustees of the $12,400 for the purposes of a school as whether  we can avoid having Miss S. at Happy Valley in any capacity. I am  not very clear as to what a Sixth Sub-race person should be but I  feel very sure he must be of quite a different type from Miss S. Or  any other rigid educationalist. 
    Faithfully,  ROBERT 
    P.S. We might turn it all over to Miss S. and merely amend our  charter to read THE UNHAPPY VALLEY FOUNDATION.  Whether answering the proposals of over-zealous Theosophists or  members of the ?(r)fringe', Robert politely but firmly maintained the  trustees' intention to steer clear of all the rigid and, in some eyes,  nonsensical aspects of Theosophy such as initiations and the consequent  hierarchical attitudes which he and Sara had never embraced. Mrs Besant  herself had not included these aspects in her concept of Happy Valley's  future. 
    Robert and Louis were both among Krishna's closest friends and  contributed heavily to what was now called Krishnamurti Writings  Incorporated or KWinc, instead of the Star Publishing Trust. But  Krishna still maintained an aloof distance from Happy Valley. He had  divorced himself from this enterprise before Mrs Besant even had it off  the ground. He was finished with Masters, the sixth sub-root race and  with Theosophy in general, at least at that time. 
    As soon as the war was over, my mother wanted to start a large  community vegetable garden in the lower valley, mostly to provide 
    203  
 
                   
 
      work for the Japanese who had been interned during the war. It was  a token drop of help in the face of such disgraceful and unnecessary  injustice as they had suffered but she felt strongly about it. Raja,  who thought it was not a feasible undertaking, dissuaded her from  the garden; but he did arrange to hire a Japanese couple, who came to  live in the smaller of Robert's cottages behind Saro Vihara. Ishi worked  in the orchard and garden and Mrs Ishi helped in the household. If they  had bitter feelings they kept them to themselves and showed us always  a courteous and cheerful demeanour. 
    In 1945, Robert and Louis went into another partnership which would  provide the seed bed for the first enterprise of Happy Valley. They  bought the old Star Camp bath-houses and cafeteria building and the  acreage around them from KWInc and were planning to remodel the  bath-houses into apartments. There were murmurings of the possibility  of a school, murmurings which Robert had intuitively foreseen some  years before. Although nothing definite was being decided along these  lines, it was in the back of both their minds that if there should be a  sudden need, the apartments would be available until more permanent  structures could be built on the Happy Valley land fifteen miles away. 
    December 17th, 1945 
    Dear Louis, 
    I have your letter of December 11th and note instructions to 
    Willie about bath-houses 3 and 2 . . . If anyone swims out of these 
    bath-houses with a clear mathematical picture of my two-thirds and 
    one-half and your one-half and one-third, it will be Albert Einstein. 
    No one else would have a chance! 
    Faithfully, 
    ROBERT 
    The nucleus that would start the school was forming. A retired  philosophy professor from Vassar, Dr Guido Ferrando, had moved  to Ojai Valley during the war and had given several series of lectures  on the American transcendentalists and on the Divine Comedy. He had  also entered into many discussions on education with Krishna, Rosalind  and Aldous Huxley. His ideas for a Socratic method of teaching fitted  in with many of Krishna's ideas but were more specific and applicable:  term papers rather than formal examinations, small classes arranged in  a circle with a flow of questions and answers between the pupils and  the teacher. Pupils would learn from asking questions and discussing  rather than being lectured to. The emphasis would be on learning to 
    204  
 
                         A School is Born 
    think and there would be no barriers between different disciplines but  an integration of subjects as well as cultures into a world view. 
    Rosalind had been for some years a member of the Ojai Valley School  Board which had originally been based on Edward Yeomans's precepts  of non-competitiveness, in classroom and sports, tolerance and a free  and open mind; similar educational principles to those which Krishna  later formulated. 
    There was a need in the valley for a co-educational high school,  especially at that moment. The ninth grade class, which included me,  was about to graduate from the Ojai Valley School. I well remember  the concern we all had as to where we would go next. Most of us,  having spent four or five years in a very progressive school, were not  enthusiastic to finish our high school days at the public school. All the  other schools in Ojai were for boys only. A ready-made tenth grade  to start with seemed an opportune moment to lay the first cornerstone  ofa long-hoped-for reality. Rosalind had been invited on to the Happy  Valley Foundation a few years before, largely due to Robert's faith,  which he had inherited from Sara and was joimned in by Louis, that  she would accomplish something important if given the chance. At  that time, Rosalind was unaware of this confidence in her, but was  to be sustained by it in the ensuing years. 
    It was Mr Robbie and Louis Zalk who made the school possible  financially. They leased for a dollar a year the old cafeteria building, to  be used for the school house. This was the beginning of their long role  as chief benefactors of the school, just as they had been of the Happy  Valley Foundation. 
    Rosalind was rapidly caught up in the practicalities of starting even a  small schools Providing equipment, housing, classrooms, kitchens and  budgets fell to her, in addition to discussing the ideology of the school  with Aldous, Raja, Krishna, Dr Ferrando and many others who had  hoped for years to be part of such an undertaking. Robert and Louis  remained largely in the background of these discussions but as trustees 
    -their undiminishing correspondence revealed their deep concern. They  both believed the school should reflect Mrs Besant's educational ideals,  based on the brotherhood of man and that all the future trustees should  be chosen with this principle in mind. In the midst of the war Robert  had emphasized these views.  The Happy Valley must be a nursery for that true peace which can  only come through understanding and good will, through sympathy  and not through domination . . . [it] is the opposite of the conception 
    205      of mechanization and regimentation, which has been dominating the 
    world of business and politics, and creating not only the war, but 
    the war of daily life. 
    In these words Mr Robbie was in accord with both Mrs Besant's  ideals and Aldous's as expressed in Case for Constructive Peace. 
    It was agreed between Krishna, Raja and Rosalind that Arya Vihara  could be used that first year as a temporary living quarters for the  boarding students until the bath-house remodelling was completed.  This was only because Krishna was planning to leave for Australia in  the summer of 1946, and to be away for a year, the first time he would  leave America since the war had begun. He had never been confined in  one place for so long and his restlessness was showing. Although he  had had the summer trips to Sequoia and Carmel, he must have missed  the large gatherings for his talks in Ommen and India. He had talked  in Ojai only once during the war, in 1944. 
    That summer of 1946 Krinsh, my mother and I returned to Sarobia  for the first gathering since 1940. This proved to be a fertile hunt- ing ground for prospective students of the Happy Valley School.  Rosalind made the most of the opportunity. It was here that she  urged Catherine Sloss to send her son out to California. In part because  of her interest in Krishna and in part because of the school situation  in Birmingham, Catherine went home sufficiently convinced to per- suade her husband that it was a good idea. Little did they realize that  Jimmy, then only fifteen, was to emigrate more or less permanently  to California. 
    A group of eminent Freudian psychoanalysts had invited Krishna for  a discussion session to Washington, DC after the Sarobia gathering.  Dr Benjamin Weininger had organized these Washington sessions and  had invited us to stay in his Maryland home. These meetings were  a new experience for Krinsh. Here he was not among his old fol- lowers who found every word and every sigh he uttered something  to cherish and remember. Men like Harry Stack Sullivan and Erich  Fromm were quite sure of their ground and their vocabulary, from  both of which Krinsh tried to dislodge them. He tried to insist on  dropping old conditioning, thought, knowledge. While some of them  felt they had come up against a blank wall and needed a new fron- tier, what Krinsh called professionalism in their vocabulary became  a frequent stumbling block. The whole session, whether successful  in terms of closer understanding or not, was arduous for Krinsh. 
    206  
 
                         A School is Born 
    He had relied emotionally for the past fourteen years on Rosalind's  total attention and enveloping care being projected toward him. She  fully understood that he needed the devotion and commitment of those  close to him no matter how detached he liked to sound. While he did  everything to encourage her to take on the school, he realized that he  had lost her undivided focus. During our stay at the Weiningers, with a  strange sense of desperation Krishna came to Rosalind's room at night.  He had not shown such indiscretion for a long time and it made her  very uncomfortable. 
    At Arya Vihara we still had the cow and the chickens, which the Ishis  had cared for in our absence, but for which Rosalind was still basically  responsible. One day the rooster Hercules did not recognize my mother  when she came to feed him and his hens. Her face was blocked by the  large pan she was holding. He rushed at her and jabbed his spur all  the way through her foot. Fortunately, no infection resulted, but the  wound was very painful; it was typical of her to have no hard feelings  towards Hercules. 
    The week the school was to open and all the boarders were to arrive,  Rosalind, unstable still from her foot wound and the long-ago effects  of a ski injury, slipped on the back steps. She broke her ankle, which  had to be set in a cast to the knee. 
    Many of the students had never experienced the joys of farm life,  Jimmy Sloss among them. The day after he arrived, the cow went into  calf-birth, and, as the calf was coming feet first and had to be turned, it  took all the help available. With my mother laid up, Willie, as the head  midwife, feeling that I, a young girl should not be present, called on  Krinsh and Jimmy to help. His mother believed she had sent her son  to Ojai to b¡§| under Krishnamurti's enlightening influence. But Jimmy,  who did not even know that hens could lay eggs without roosters  around, who was not too sure just how milk got from the cow into  the bottle and had never seen anything being born, felt this was quite  a startling though edifying introduction to Ojai. In spite of the novice  midwives, all went well with the calf and Tina provided good milk  throughout the school year. Not long after that our eccentric cat Minnie  decided to have her kittens on Jimmy's bed. 
    Suddenly Krinsh became desperately ill with high fever and kidney 
    pain. As my mother was on crutches and nine pupils were living in Arya 
    Vihara, it was a crisis. Krinsh would allow no one but my mother near 
    him. She moved him from Pine Cottage to the front room in the big 
    house, where she had nursed Nitya before he died. There she undertook 
    207  
 
                      to nurse Krinsh night and day, at the same time somehow managing  to run the household and oversee the organization of the school. 
    As she found crutches impossibly cumbersome while feeding and  sponge-bathing Krinsh, she had to crawl around the room, dragging  her encased leg. Even in a semi-delirious state, Krinsh insisted that there  be no other nurse and made her promise if he became unconscious that  in no event would he be taken to the hospital. He was convinced he  would surely die there. He refused also to have a doctor, but Hugh  Keller, a friend and chiropractor, checked him every day. It was Hugh''s  professional opinion that Krishna's illness was entirely due to his celibate  life which, he thought, had affected the prostate gland. If she had been  capable of such feelings at that moment, this diagnosis might have  caused Rosalind a fleeting moment of amusement. 
    Aldous and Maria, as they had done when Sophia was dying, came  very often and sat quietly in the patio, giving their loving support. They  felt Rosalind was in a very bad position with her promise to Krishna  and would be severely criticized if anything should happen to him. 
    One particularly critical night, while my mother stayed by Krinsh's  side, my father and I paced up and down the driveway under the  brilliantly starred Ojai sky. I shall never forget the love he expressed  for Krinsh, saying our lives would be so strange and empty without  him. He could not have guessed then that it would not be death that  would cause that emptiness for him. That time had not yet come when  they would no longer be close. In spite of difficulties, there had always  been a tie, which even Keiro, by whatever means, had recognized, for  better and for worse. 
    Eventually a urologist was consulted at the Sansum clinic in Santa  Barbara. He diagnosed that Krishna had nephritis. After intensive care  for over six weeks, Krishna slowly began to recover and entered into  six months' convalescence. Of course, all his travel plans for that  year had been cancelled, but there was no way to cancel the use  of Arya Vihara as a dormitory. It was imperative to keep everyone  quiet during the worst of his illness. We all sat in the living-room  in the evenings, doing our homework as quietly as if we were in a  library or monastery. We were allowed to play classical music softly  on the phonograph. That young people from diverse homes could be so  co-operative and, with such good will, show spontaneous consideration  was an unexpected precedent in those first formative months for a school  that was based on precisely such ideals. Some of the pupils had never  heard of Krinsh, some were Theosophists, a few were children of his  followers.  
 
                   
A School is Born 
    As Krinsh got better, the young people in the house did not seem  to bother him. He had grown a beard and would sit about in his  bathrobe and look over our activities with increasing interest. He  came out occasionally to chat especially with Jimmy, for whom he  had a particular affinity. Jimmy already had the clear mind of the  mathematician he would become. Some were too shy to speak to him  and others not shy at all. [ believe his recuperation was enhanced by  this mingling with young people. We all felt his quiet observation of  us and in part returned 1t. He had often said that to help someone with  a problem all you had to do was understand it without judgment, to see  it clearly, and in time this understanding would be transmitted to the  other person. His non-verbal self was at its best in such circumstances.  To have had the opportunity to experience that directly was worth a  hundred of his lectures. 
    Thanks to Louis and Robert the financial end of the school held up in  spite of a ratio of twelve students to eight teachers. There was a great  deal of enthusiasm for the project. It seemed that finally Mrs Besant's  vision was shaping into reality, even though the school had not been  built on Happy Valley land. Although no one realized it then, it would  be another thirty years before the school could move there. 
    The walnut ranch was still the only source of income for Happy  Valley and it just barely paid expenses each year as the correspondence  between Louis and Mr Robbie showed: 
    October 31st, 1946 
    Dear Louis, 
    I have your letter of the 29th in regard to the proposed expenses 
    on the Happy Valley Nut Factory. 
    Our trouble in blowing the nuts oft the trees will be greatly 
    exceeded by our trouble in blowing the other nuts off the land as 
    soon as the Fifth and Sixth Races begin to move in. 
    Financing the school was to become an ever-increasing problem.  Fortunately, Rosalind was adept at finding ways to economize; both  men appreciated that quality in her while they recognized that she  sometimes became overly optimistic in her expectations of people. 
    November 13th, 1946  Dear Louis,  I think you must have heard from Rosalind about employing F  to build the dormitory. Rosalind was at first too enthusiastic and is 
    209      now perhaps a little too disillusioned, but anyway I will be quite  content to have Neutra or any other Neutral architect you may  choose. 
    Rosalind and Krishna weathered the first year of the school, but their  relationship had undergone a change. Nursing him had put an emotional  and physical strain on her. Perhaps they both felt that they had been too  closely confined during the past seven years. The heavy work during  those war years had taken much of Rosalind's vitality. She had begun  to feel Krishna's constant presence and needs taxing. She welcomed  the thought ofa little space and time apart from him. 
    The school rested heavily on her shoulders, although she had no  official title and never took a salary. Dr Ferrando was not able, due  to age, health, and lack of experience to run the organizational end,  although he was a wonderful figure at the helm and in the classroom.  Rosalind also had to oversee the converting of the bath-houses into  dining-room and dormitory space for the second year of the school.  There were now too many students to fit into Arya Vihara. For  Rosalind, the school had become, and was to remain for twenty years,  an eighteen-hour-a-day as Robert was among the first to 
   job, notice. 
    August 1947  Dearest Rozzie, 
    Don't work too hard nor worry too much . . . last year we had 12  pupils and no dormitory and this year we shall have 12 dormitories  and no pupils which makes a perfect average . . . 
    The dormitories were finished in time for the opening of the second 
    year, leaving Louis and Robert with still more mortgages to pay off.  They were indeed the angels behind the scenes. Louis wrote to Robert  in January 1948: 
    Dear Robert, 
    . . I note your fear as to my getting to heaven through the  Happy Valley back door. My idea of heavenly developments on  Happy Valley would be if we raised forty tons of walnuts this year  and got about thirty cents per pound. But so far we are very short  of rain indeed. There was an Indian chief who came to town from  Oregon the other day, and he caused a very minor sprinkle in Los  Angeles. I hope that he is still actively dancing around a spot in the  ground and that Old Man Coyote will hear his invocations.

    Now for spiritually minded people, it is a shame that the subject  of money intrudes itself at every point. You know that together we  owe $4000 on a mortgage on the second building. [ am intending to  clear up my share sometime this year since I do not like the smell of  mortgages. I venture to say that you feel the same. 
    . may [ suggest in the spirit of the deep friendship between  us, that both of us, in our Wills, protect the future of the School ¡Ð  just in case Karma uses the actor's wooden hook and yanks us away  from the stage before we meet?
