18 Wrightwood 
    The Huxleys had a home in the Mojave desert in a small spot called  Llano. There was nothing but a curve in the road and a sign to  distinguish Llano from any other spot in that vast stretch of pinons  and Joshua trees. Aldous began to suffer from bronchial trouble there  and in the course of their frequent explorations they had discovered a  mountain town between the desert and Los Angeles called Wrightwood.  Aldous was much relieved by the mountain air. But poor Maria detested  the village, found the houses ugly, and the altitude made her slightly 
    ill. She called herself a desert rat and Aldous a mountain squirrel and  never came to like Wrightwood; but with her characteristic concern for  Aldous's well-being, she cheerfully accepted an impractical and badly  made house and all the difficulties involved in living in such a remote  place in wartime.  Late spring 1945 found the world still in the throes of terror and  chaos; the future was far from clear. The first atomic bomb had been  detonated, even though it was afterwards admitted within scientific  circles that there was no absolute certainty the whole atmosphere would  not be ignited by this experiment. Aldous was one of those few who  saw so clearly at that moment the future consequences of such an  experiment. With the details coming to light of the concentration  camps on the one side and the results of fire bombings of much of  Germany on the other, and the plight of refugees all over Europe,  there was some reason to believe that much of the world had run  amok. 
    Using affectionate persistence, the Huxleys prevailed upon us to spend  the rest of that summer in Wrightwood. As usual, it was the three of us,  my mother, Krinsh and I who made this move. My father would drive  up from Hollywood or Ojai for an occasional weekend. Maria, in her  letters to Rosalind had begged that we pretend to like Wrightwood,  even if we didn't, to make Aldous happy. 
    We found them painting their house, Aldous smeared from head to  toe, valiantly wielding a paintbrush. To us, the village was charming 
    193  
 
                   
 
   
    enough, not Alpine or with the overpowering stillness and magnitude  of Sequoia, but we did not share Maria's dislike. 
    Wrightwood is dry, austere, without the attraction of water or the  accompanying noise of water sports. Years later when I had seen the  Himalayas, I felt the affinity here. The silver earth was studded with  pine and fremontia, small clumps of lupin lingered that first summer  and the Indian paint brush in occasional bursts of deep orange nestled  by mica-flecked rocks. 
    We saw the Huxleys every day Ал either for tea at their house or for  dinner at ours. Rosalind and Maria each tried to help the other in her  own way. Maria included us on many occasions when interesting people  came up to see Aldous. for she understood that Krinsh particularly  seemed to need these encounters. Maria began a hope chest for me,  although [ was just a child. T still have the lovely Belgian linens she  gave me then. Preparing food and running large households, something  of a hardship for Maria, was fairly routine for Rosalind, so she often  provided the meals for the whole crowd. Thus our lives, though  in different houses, were linked by mealtimes and also by walks, a  daily routine for both Aldous and Krinsh, accompanied by whoever  could keep up with Aldous's long stride. which was easily matched  by Krinsh's fast one. These were the occasions of their most serious  talks together, and I would glean particles of profound utterance as I  drifted between them and Maria and Rosalind with their, to me, more  intriguing talk about friends and family. 
    There is one evening that first summer that still stands out in my  memory. Raja had come up from Hollywood and after dinner the  three men remained in the living-room, while Maria, Rosalind and |  retreated to a bedroom to chat about lighter matters than we suspected  the men would indulge in. Through the thin wall we could hear and  distinguish their voices. each with his unique, clear British accent and  beautiful pitch. Like a string trio, themes picked up in turn, never  interrupting each other, they played out a conversation that rose and  fell in sonorous tones in a minor scale, gradually winding down to  a dead silence that lasted many minutes. Overcome by curiosity we  crept into the room to see what had befallen them. Three pairs of eves  were bent on the floor, faces sombre, each lost in a private gloom into  which they had so harmoniously talked themselves. It was the middle  of August 1945. 
    Finally the war was over, but like Aldous, Krishna and Raja and 
    many others who had insight towards the future, Mr Robbie saw the 
    darker side of victory.

    Dearest Radha, 
    We are of course tremendously pleased that peace has come but 
    there isn't the same thrill as there was when the last war ended for 
    then everyone was full of hope that there would be no more wars 
    and this time we merely rejoice that this war is over and the next 
    one not yet begun. 
    And a month later he wrote to Rosalind, ?(r)The Atomic bomb seems to  put the last nail in the coffin of Christian civilization. If only Genghis  Khan could have had the use of it he could have killed 180,000,000  people in one year instead of only 18,000. 
    Before that summer ended Krishna and Rosalind had been shown the  cabin at Wrightwood which Krishna was to name Greenwood Gate.  They stood together under the great three-hundred-year-old oak tree  that is still there and both felt certain this was the right cabin for us. It  had been built of whole logs nearly a hundred years before by the first  forest ranger in that area. In the 1920s a wealthy lady from Beverly Hills  had added, in the same style, bedrooms and bath, hardwood floors and  other comforts, before she lost everything including the cabin in the  Depression. There was a wistaria-covered porch and beautiful stone  patio. A surrounding forest of pines sheltered the cabin from the sun,  which Krinsh so detested. Aldous, on the other hand, always sought  all the light he could find and thought our cabin sombre though  charming. 
    Using a small sum left to Rosalind by Sara Logan, Raja, with  considerablg trouble, arranged the purchase. There had been a flood  the winter before that had washed away several houses but went right  around this one. Its elderly owner had been on her knees all night  praying for survival. A good part of the mountain had come down  in an avalanche of late April snow followed by heavy rains. Raja had  to wait for an act of Congress to allocate funds for the reparation of  the dirt dam between us and the wash, before the property could be  released for purchase. 
    (That was just the beginning of tribulations for us and the cabin.  Following her vision that this cabin would have a long place in our  lives, my mother gave it to my husband and me twenty years later,  urging us never to sell it. To this day we are glad we haven't, although  there were times when we were sorely tempted. There was another  flood just after it became ours, causing us to remove twenty truckloads 
    195  
 
                   
 
    of silt from the house and the garage. The cabin is standing on the tail 
    end of the San Andreas fault, on target for the worst earthquake of the 
    century. But our family has enjoyed it along with its resident carpenter 
    ants and bumble-bees for the past forty years.)  Wrightwood marked the end of our annual treks to Sequoia. Our time  was pleasantly intertwined with the Huxleys. Maria and Rosalind shared  their domestic problems. 
    My dearest Rosalind, 
    I missed you at Wrightwood but I found out much usefulness  for both of us and this is to impart it . . . I found excellent men  to do urgent things; regulate oil stove . . . new locks. In fact  quite important details. And I found that Mr Steele though slow  is wonderfully conscientious, willing and capable. If you need him  for stoves or electric light or gas or anything don't hesitate. I found  that your friend of Australia, Harry may become very useful to all  of us as an odd-job man. He seems honest and certainly cheap. He  talks too much . . . 60?ед an hour. He is sorting apples for you and  leaving them there. They are rotting . . . There is a Mrs Strott who  lives near the apple orchard . . . we heard the bells of her cows, near  the little lake, when we walked. I had her once. I think she may be  very useful and go to you if you insisted that you needed her Ал 75?ед  an hour. Tell her I am your friend. I believe she rather enjoyed the  work with different sort of people Ал Oh dear, how hard some people  work. She is happy because she had six ?(r)wonderful boys'. 
    We shall arrive late on Friday morning and pass by your house  hoping to arrange a walk or something else. 
    The days were warm and last night was the only one I spent there  . . . I slept atrociously on what I had thought was a divine bed which  took me all day to prepare for Aldous. So I shall have to think up  something else; the difficulty is it must be seven feet. 
    The departure was dramatic under a darkening sky, the first flakes  of mixed snow and rain and a howling wind. When I reached the  desert a pretty moon seemed ironically to watch my hurrying car; so  slowed down and enjoyed the radiant peace while the clouds crowded  our hills. And so I am home and happy. I go to town tomorrow. It  will be wonderful to meet and I have made some cakes. To send to  Europe as you suggested. Eight pounds for them and the rest for us  when you will please come to tea. One batch turned out like toffee  but your family is sweet about my misfits so I am keeping them for  you! Good night my very dearest. May I say that [ am more fond 
    196  
 
                         Wrightwood 
    of you than ever and that it is a very happy feeling to be so fond of  someone. | hope you are well. Your family has my loves [sic] too.  Make sure they all have warm clothes. The cold has a slow creepy  strength which suddenly has paralysed one and the face is green and  the nose is red and the hands clumsy Ал and yet that is where we  choose to live. 
    When late spring came we moved to Wrightwood for long periods,  taking carloads of produce from the ranch and returning every few  weeks to replenish supplies. 
    In between major reprovisioning in Ojai, we made weekly trips to  the Safeway in San Bernardino. Very occasionally, we could persuade  Krinsh to go to a movie down there with us. He refused to go to  romantic films, but enjoyed Westerns. Whenever there was a kissing  scene he covered his eyes in horror and said, ?(r)What rot!' 
    While this attitude may have been perfectly understandable to his  devotees, it seemed somewhat inconsistent to me and probably even  more so to my mother. 
    I was now fourteen Ал no longer a small, unobtrusive child. While  they never made me feel de trop, 1 sensed they needed to be alone,  especially in the mornings when Krinsh went into my mother's room  where she often would have taken her breakfast tray to bed. This was  a small treat which she particularly enjoyed when away from all the  ranch chores. I was not interested in their conversations any more. 
    I wandered off by myself up the wash through the waves of desert  heat marbled by wafts of fog-cooled breezes. Sometimes a friend from  Ojai came for a visit. But our household seemed strange to most of  them and I felt easier left alone, to sketch, to read among other things  an old edition of War and Peace in four leather-bound volumes that I  brought from Arya Vihara. In that edition the English was interspersed  with long passages of French which I could not get through without  Krinsh's help. Sometimes 1 swam in the local pond or practised the  piano in the local schoolhouse. These were my summer mornings and  [ was perfectly content with them. We always rested after lunch and  then went to the Huxleys for tea, and a walk. Or they came to us for  dinner and an evening around the huge stone fireplace, built so long  ago by the forest ranger. There were no telephones so plans were made  from one day to the next. 
    Greta Garbo came for the day and I trailed along the Blue Ridge  behind her and Krinsh. She was easily as beautiful as her legend. She  was without a trace of make-up, except perhaps on her lashes. The only 
    197  
 
                   
 
    evidence of vanity was an anti-wrinkle plaster between her eyebrows.  Her hair was straight. She wore a straw hat and pants. She asked  ?(r)profound' questions of the ?(r)Indian Sage', questions parried, averted,  unanswered. Deepest blue eyes glanced up under those famous lashes  to test his imperviousness, or was she genuinely ingenuous? Who could  ever say? They were two such private people. I just hoped she didn't  notice the look Krinsh threw me as he often did when I was there to  witness some particular embarrassment, as though I could somehow  cast back a little sympathy. I could feel his question, ?(r)What am I  to do with this?' Yet I also knew of his secret yen for the world of  actors and popular renown. He had a peculiar affinity for it and had  once told me, ?(r)I would like to write just one big Broadway hit, just  to see how it feels,?А└ or sometimes it would be ?(r)Just one best-selling  detective novel.' 
    There was a picnic with the Huxleys and Stravinskys also on the Blue  Ridge at an altitude of 8000 feet. My mother, as usual, had brought  food for everyone and laid it out while the rest of us walked. That  day someone or something persuaded Krinsh to take a sip of wine  and he suddenly fell back off the bench in a dead faint. Everyone  except Rosalind was alarmed. She knew how easily he could faint. In  such company Krinsh always looked a bit aloof and outside the circle,  except with Aldous and Maria with whom he felt perfectly at home.  He showed affection for Aldous, but maintained the usual formality  with Maria that he reserved for all women, seldom using first names,  preferring Madam or Signora. No matter how eminent our guests were,  it was still Krinsh who was always the centre of attention. The more he  appeared to retreat from this position, the more it encompassed him.  There was something in common between him and Greta Garbo in  this. We had witnessed her attempts at incognito when shopping in  Beverly Hills which never failed to draw attention to herself. Everyone  knew exactly who she was. 
    One day we were invited to tea at the Huxleys to meet a psychologist,  his wife and secretary. I was sitting next to the wife and suddenly noticed  a complete change of expression, although she seemed to be attentive to  our conversation. A moment later, her original demeanour returning, she  asked me to repeat what I had just said. Maria explained to me later that  she was a split personality, just like the woman in the true case history  of the film, Three Faces of Eve. But in this case both personalities were  compatible and helpful to each other. I never forgot this extraordinary  intimate glimpse of that unusual woman. 
    Even in Wrightwood there was always a lot of work to do. We did 
    198  
 
                   
Wrightwood 
    almost everything ourselves. Krinsh decided it would be nice to have  a rose garden. Perhaps he missed the one that had been taken out years  before at Arya Vihara for wartime economy. We planted a row of roses  along the wall above the driveway. The soil was basically rocks of  serpentine and mica, grey and infertile and much digging and mulching  had to be done. Eventually the roses did very well. He and Rosalind  also made a small bathroom down in the garage. A local plumber  installed the fixtures but they did the tiling and painting themselves.  This bathroom was for Krinsh, who slept in the living-room and liked  to get up very early. 
    When we returned from an afternoon walk one day there was a large  rattlesnake curled comfortably on the mat by the kitchen door. Krinsh  was not lacking in courage but it was my mother who had the knack  of dealing with difficult creatures. With gentle urging from a broom  and a firm voice she told the snake to remove itself and find another  home. She was surprisingly persuasive and the reptile slowly uncoiled  and moved off into the brush. We didn't see it again. To my knowledge,  my mother never killed or harmed anything. In this she was like Mr  Robbie, who had once remarked to Beato when she was about to swat  a fly, ?(r)Let it live. It values its life as much as you do yours.?А└ Beato never  again killed anything either. 
    My mother also had her own ideas about politics. Even Aldous  could not influence her on issues about which she felt strongly. She  had grown up in a politically oriented household. Her father had  been a state senator with a strong socialist bent and the family had  weathered many campaigns. During the Alger Hiss trial, there were  many heated discussions about his innocence. My mother was certain  he was not_guilty, but thought, in any case, he had not received a  fair trial. Everyone else tried to argue her down, not because they  thought Hiss was guilty but because her certainty seemed to them  irrational. Although Krinsh had always maintained that if a person  were not liberal in his youth he would be mentally ossified in his middle  years, next to my mother he definitely sounded politically conservative,  but when my Aunt Erma was present, who was not only a staunch  Republican, which she saw as the party of Lincoln, but also allowed  herself on occasion to sound pro-American and mildly nationalistic,  Krinsh would remind her, sometimes quite sharply, of the importance  of not thinking in terms of nationalism and ideology. Krinsh was not  a political thinker but lumped both religious and political ideologies in  one trash bin. All leaders were on the wrong path, politicians, teachers,  experts of any kind were to be eschewed. This was helpful for adults 
    199      with overly encumbered minds who were seeking freedom from their  conditioning, but for young students hoping to get educated, it was not  helpful. It took me quite a few years to overcome the feeling that what  I was being told in the lectures at college was anything but nonsense. I  would find myself reflecting the supercilious attitude that I had so often  seen Krinsh put on in the face of intellectual power. While I was never  permitted by any of my adults to make derogatory or even personal  remarks, Krinsh occasionally did so, perhaps unwittingly or somehow  stirred to an inner exasperation. It was seldom this happened, but 1  remembered him saying after a long walk with Aldous, ?(r)His mind is  like a wastebasket.?А└ I am sure Aldous would never have suspected that  Krinsh would make such a comment. 
    I look back now on those years at Wrightwood as the last of our happy  times together with Krinsh. Both my parents had occasional quarrels  with him, but they were of the same nature as they had always been 
    Ал usually because he had lied about something. My mother asked him  once why-he lied and he replied with astonishing frankness, ?(r)Because  of fear.'  In some ways Rosalind's psychology was so simple. She thought  once a fault was recognized and admitted all you had to do was decide  to stop it. She never recognized the complexity of Krinsh's problem  until it was too late. My father, on the other hand, tended to make  everything so complex that he became mired in his own speculations. 
    There was still a great deal of love: between my mother and Krinsh,  from my father to Krinsh and possibly from Krinsh to my father, though  of this I am still uncertain. I never had any doubt of the love I had for  each of the three of them and which they all had for me.
