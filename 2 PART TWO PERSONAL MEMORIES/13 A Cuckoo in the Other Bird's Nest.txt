13 A Cuckoo in the Other Bird's Nest 
    During my early childhood Raja was in poor health. He had a series  of operations between which he had to spend much time travelling  on behalf of the work he was doing, editing and publishing Krishna's  talks, and organizing the immensely complicated camps for thousands  of people, at Ojai in the spring and at Ommen every summer. 
    Although endowed with a fine physique and natural fitness, unlike  Krishna who was compelled to spend a great portion of his life building  himself up physically, since his youth Raja had avoided any of the  precautions that would ensure continued good health. He disdained  exercise, drank too much coffee, led irregular hours and ate sporadically,  either too much or too little. He may well have been put off by the  almost ritualistic adherence to physical health measures that Krishna  insisted upon for himself and tried to instil in those close to him and  by Rosalind's insistence on a proper diet. But Raja had displayed a  rebellious disregard for his health long before meeting either of them,  as warnings in early letters to him from Leadbeater testify. 
    When Krishna returned to Ojai in October 1931, and first saw me  he surprised Rosalind by asking, ?(r)Do you think it is Nitya?' 
    He took me on with a fierce protectiveness, hovering like a lion over  my crib and never allowing any stranger to touch me. It was he and  not Raja who did all the things that most fathers of that era left to their  W1ves Or nurses. 
    Rosalind divided her time between Krishna in Ojai and Raja, who  was recovering from a sinus operation, in Hollywood. Neither man  was left alone in her absence. Erma and Sophia took care of Raja and  one of the Star workers, Hazel Crowe, who lived in a small guest  house behind Arya Vihara, unobtrusively provided Krishna with his  meals when Rosalind wasn't there. 
    Besides the two men in Rosalind's life there was me, a few months'  old baby to take around with her and care for. It must have been easier  for her in Hollywood, in a well-heated house and with a mother and  sister to help. Arya Vihara still had no heat, only the fireplaces, and the

    cold, dark winter mornings in the large empty house were not entirely  pleasant. Krishna, however, was a warm and loving companion to her  and did his best to be helpful. He liked to tell me in later years exactly  how helpful he had been, changing my diapers, rocking my crib while  Rosalind had an afternoon siesta, giving me oil rubs in the warm midday  sun, being a true Indian amma or nurse, at least so he felt. There is no  doubt that he must have spent a considerable amount of time with me  for since my earliest memories he filled a special and unique place in  my heart, not as a parent but certainly as much more than a nurse. |  understood at a very young age that the depth and scope of affection  in our circle was not related to a kinship of blood or legal ties. 
    Officially for most of that winter of 1931, Krishna declared himself  to be in samadhi. A reporter had asked him if he were Christ and he  replied that he was ⌒ in the true sense; a somewhat puzzling admission  in one who wished to discourage followers, some of whom, including  Lady Emily, were beginning to wonder if his life were an escape from  responsibility, for he managed to live always in beautiful places without  facing the sort of problems that those who work hard to support their  families must face. 
    Krishna replied that it was not an escape to avoid plunging into  unnecessary relationships, jealousies and ways of life. He had deliberately  avoided the entanglements of family, along with the necessity of earning  a living, though he still believed he could have made a lot of money - even as a beggar. This disclaimer of family existence would have baffled  any objective observer of his life over those next few months. 
    Spring came and with it the Ojai Camp. Suddenly Arya Vihara was  full of close friends, the excitement of hopefully uplifted spirits waiting  for Krishna's words. My mother slept in the large front bedroom and 1  in an attached glassed-in porch. Raja did not share these quarters when  in Ojai, but had similar rooms facing the lawn, separated by a long back  hallway. Krishna still slept, as he always would, in Pine Cottage. Arya  Vihara returned to monastic quietude at night, with Raja working as was  his habit well past midnight in his office, guests and devotees departing  at an early hour. 
    Krishna was particularly elated after his first talk that spring. There  would always be great ups and downs in the flow of his magnetic  power. Some people would come away from his talks shaking their  heads in wonder, unsure what he had actually said but quite bowled  over by it. Sometimes just one sentence would strike an individual and  open for him a vital new insight. But Krishna always knew when a talk 
    116  
 
                   
A Cuckoo in the Other Bird's Nest 
    had been particularly inspired. Even if he said afterwards, as he usually  did, ?(r)I don't remember anything about it, how was it??± we could tell  by the glow on his face, the private smile, that he knew exactly what  he had done and how his audience had taken it. As he grew older his  energy would lapse after a few hours and he would need to be alone for  a long rest, but when he was still young he was often too stimulated to  be alone. It was almost as if another self had awakened or come to life  in him. 
    Rosalind remembered that first talk in the spring of 1932 for a reason  of her own. She remembered his excitement and restlessness when they  returned to Arya Vihara. He was full of laughter and sparkle as he went  off to his cottage, but when the big house had settled into darkness he  came back and into her bed. It was not comfort for a sick child that  he was seeking now. 
    What followed then assumed all the force of the inevitable, though  at the time it took her by surprise. Yet she came to realize that he  had been playing the role of her own child's father for some months  and had lavished on her all the care and solicitude of a passionate and  fond husband ⌒ a role from which Raja appeared to have withdrawn,  enabling Rosalind to slip into a love affair that would last for more  than twenty-five years. 
    Assuming that he was aware of the condition of Rosalind and Raja's  marriage, and allowing for his unconventional attitude toward marriage  in general, that its vows had little meaning to him, Krishna's actions are  understandable, but not excusable in the context of his relationship with  Raja, who had given his life to helping him. Nor were they excusable in  the context of the chaste image he continued to project and was careful  not to tarnish, although it meant living a sub-rosa life. He would continue  to affirm publicly that true love does not distinguish between human  relationships but is boundlessly there for everyone. Yet privately over  the coming years, he would frequently and eloquently declare his love  to Rosalind and insist that ?(r)what 1s between us is the most important  thing in our lives'. 
    The miracle is that so few, if any, seemed to have suspected what was  going on. That this ?(r)perfect' being could have such a relationship would  have been a reductio ad absurdum to the Theosophists, who would have  been shocked enough had Krishna entered into a legitimate marriage,  and the new non-Theosophical followers would continue to place him  on a celibate pedestal. But there was at least one exception, Mme de  Manziarly, who in 1938 heard her daughter Mima say, ?(r)How charming  and sweet, the way Krishna loves Rosalind and helps her with Radha,' 
    117      replied, ?(r)Hmmph! A cuckoo in the other bird's nest.?± Mima Porter told  me this in 1984, explaining that when her mother startled her with such  a comment she pushed it to the back of her mind and did not think  about it once until future events reminded her. 
    Rosalind, too, had a natural aura of innocence which protected  her throughout her life from suspicion, at-least among her closest  friends. Even Raja suspected nothing until he was actually told twenty  years later. Yet the discomfort and sense of isolation that he would  feel increasingly to be his lot might well have been spawned in this  shadowed area of their lives. 
    At the age of thirty-seven, Krishna had experienced his first sexual  relationship, and, it 1s reasonable to believe, with someone he had  secretly loved for many years. The new and joyful exuberance that  he often expressed in those years was naturally taken by his followers  to reflect his transcendent spiritual condition, an expression of the  enlightened mystic, rather than of the happy lover. 
    In those early days, their times alone together were few. Rosalind  remembers one summer night, as she was sitting with Krishna on the  roof at Arya Vihara and looking at the starlight on his face, how she  was struck by the beauty of him as he told her of his love for her. She  had always been deeply moved by poetry and he was a natural poet. 
    Yet, when one loses through death a young, idealized and unrealized  love, it can stand in the way ofa complete love with another. Rosalind  would always feel that Nitya had been her special love; but that love  had never been consummated by so much as a kiss and would remain  a romantic ideal. Her love for Raja had been based on a solid bond of  friendship and perhaps she had not been totally dismayed when her  marriage was re-established on that basis. Krishna provided all that  was lacking in her marriage, physical love and the warm, attentive  companionship that she had not found with Raja. 
    While she and Raja would always feel a profound respect for each  other in their sharing of ideals and values, the trivial mechanics of  daily life had tended to pull them apart. She was a morning person;  he worked late and slept well into the morning. She was active and he  was sedentary. They did not share the same sense of humour. None of  these things alone was enough to destroy a marriage, but added to their  lack of physical love created a considerable void. As the years passed  Raja would become more and more the far point of the triangle. 
    Krishna and Raja returned to India in December 1932. They had not  seen Mrs Besant for two years. In spite of all the dissension between 
    118  
 
                   
 
  A Cuckoo in the Other Bird's Nest 
    him and the Theosophists, Krishna was greeted warmly with garlands  and a welcoming committee and invited to lecture on the Compound.  Mrs Besant was in a sad state. Her memory was failing badly, but she  knew him and Raja and showed them great affection. Krishna felt quite  out of place now at Adyar, asserting that they did not want him  around. According to Rukmini, George Arundale had told Krishna he  was very welcome at Adyar, but if he could not refrain from making  fun of the Theosophists and being generally disruptive he should leave.  Krishna interpreted this as a definite shutting out and would continue  to make a point of this. 
    Throughout my childhood I would hear antagonistic comments about  George, not only from Krinsh but also in a milder way from those in  our circle who aligned themselves with Krinsh against the Theosophists  and also from those like the Logans who remained Theosophists but still  had a critical though never unkind attitude toward a few individuals. 1  suspect that all these attitudes stemmed from Krinsh's strong assertions  that George Arundale was responsible for his banishment from Adyar.  They never saw that this exile was brought on by his own behaviour  and was in fact self-imposed. 
    One day Jinarajadasa took Raja aside and mildly reprimanded him  for letting Krishna get so out of hand.  ?(r)Who am I', Raja replied with some annoyance, ?(r)that I can tell him  how to behave?' 
    Jinarajadasa then told Raja it was a pity he should go on with Krishna.  ?(r)If you would leave him and come back to Adyar, we would make you  the Vice-President here.' I heard these same words, in retrosopect, forty  years later when I first met Rukmini's brother, Yagna, at Adyar. 
    ?(r)We Theosophists lost a valuable leader when your father went with  Krishnaji,?± he told me. ?(r)He should come back, even now, to Adyar.'  But it had already been too late in 1932. My father was too committed  aman. 
    When Leadbeater came from Australia to be with Mrs Besant at her  deathbed, and then fell ill himself, he heard that Krishna, on his last  visit, had referred to those at Adyar as exploiters, people who influenced  others for their own purposes. ?(r)Am I an exploiter?' the old man asked  Rukmini, who was taking care of him.! Leadbeater died the following  year with his question unanswered, at least by Krishna, who never saw  him again. 
    In April 1933 Krishna and Raja took their final leave of Mrs Besant.  She died five months later and for the next fifty years Krishna would not  set foot in Adyar. With George Arundale as the next President, his ties 
    119      with the Theosophical Society were completely severed. His 'memory  of a past so heavily dependent on Theosophy was, he claimed, wiped  clean. This claim was fundamental to his interpretation of the free mind  which had been evolving since his rejection of his role as the vehicle.  In order for the mind to be liberated, there can be no psychological  memory of all the sticky miseries that society imposes on those who  seek respectability. Total loss of memory also entitled him to a claim  of originality in all his teachings, yet they bear a marked similarity to  many of the Upanishads and the teachings of the Buddha, in both of  which he was thoroughly well versed in his youth at Adyar. Of course  there are those who will say that there is only one truth and the truth  always sounds the same. 
    In the summer of 1933, Rosalind took me with her to Ommen, where she  met Krishna and Raja, returning from India. As usual, Raja was totally  absorbed in his work and also suffered intermittently from painful bouts  of rheumatism. But there were many friends around who took a special  interest in me, and Rosalind had a plentiful supply of helping hands. 
    Even at Ommen, Krishna would sometimes ask Rosalind to join  him in his cottage and, although she complied, it made her nervous.  Secrecy was much more in his interest than in hers, yet he seemed  undaunted by the possibility of discovery. His attitude was realistic.  One day Annie Vigeveno, a camp member, had been asked to go  to Krishna's cabin to clean it. She assumed he was out, and was  sweeping up the sitting-room when she heard Rosalind and Krishna  talking in the bedroom and remembers feeling a little surprised at  some of Krishna's uncomplimentary comments about people. She was  not otherwise disturbed by the situation, assuming Krishna must be  getting a massage from Rosalind; she did not allow any other possibility  to enter her mind. She admits she would have thought it all very strange  had they been anyone else.? 
    Rosalind did not feel guilty towards Raja for she felt he had given  her symbolic freedom. She evidently had not concerned herself about  Krishna's feelings of guilt, if he were capable of such. That summer  something moved Krishna to write a letter to Raja which he first gave  Rosalind to read. She found it beautiful and was touched by what it  said. In it Krishna explained that he loved Rosalind and her baby and  wanted to take full responsibility for them. And privately to her, he  said they would be married and go and live on some island. She is  certainly not the first woman in the world to have heard those words,  and it is an indication of her naivet¨| that she gave them any credence 
    120  
 
                   
A Cuckoo in the Other Bird's Nest 
    at all. When Krishna returned from this mission, he said that Raja had  hurt him by laughing in his face and brushing aside the whole idea.  Raja might well have asked how he proposed to take care of anyone  else when he could not even take care of himself. Krishna must have  made it clear to Rosalind that there would be no such alternative, as  living openly together without marriage, and Rosalind too felt that  their sexual relationship was their own business and not that of the  world at large. She saw Krishna as a man and a lover before she saw  him as a world teacher; she had always had trouble seeing him in that  role. It was perhaps the very fact that he was not remarkable to her  that made it possible for her to love him ⌒ and for him to love her,  in the way in which he did. 
    Rosalind did not question at this time that Krishna really had given  Raja the letter. That Raja never spoke to her about it and behaved toward  her exactly as before, with no apparent reaction, might have made most  people wonder ⌒ yet it is characteristic of Rosalind to have overlooked  this and merely to have assumed that Raja was not upset by what he had  learned, and had quietly accepted it. When I questioned Raja fifty years  later he was certain there had been no letter (if there had been it would  undoubtedly have been found in his archives for he never threw away  the slightest scrap). Raja remembered only a vague remark by Krishna,  which he took as one of his quixotic ideas, never guessing the true  nature of his and Rosalind's relationship. Because Krishna had known  Rosalind first, and because Raja recognized that there was a special  feeling between them that existed before his marriage, he felt that it  was not his prerogative to question a relationship which he assumed  to be quite innocent. 
    When the talks at Ommen were over, Krishna was scheduled to go to  Norway. Raja, still very involved with business at Ommen, could not  accompany Krishna. So, quite naturally, Rosalind went instead, leaving  me in the care of my father and some very devoted ladies at Ommen,  Anneke Korndorfer and Annie Vigeveno. That was the first time my  mother had left me except with my grandmother. It was implicitly  understood by those around Raja and Rosalind that their lives were  dedicated to a high purpose which involved taking care of Krishna and  for this reason it is unlikely that anyone questioned these arrangements.  The love affair continued in Norway more ardently than ever. 
    On returning to California in late summer, Raja helped Erma and Sophia  to buy a house on Gower Street below the Hollywood foothills. He  established the Star Publishing Trust office on an adjacent property. 
    121  
 
                   
 
    This neighbourhood bordered the land of the former Theosophical  headquarters and was still heavily populated by Theosophists as well  as those devoted to Krishna. Raja spent more and more of his time  in Hollywood, content with the companionship of Sophia and Erma,  as well as numerous friends. If he was unconsciously aware of the  odd-man-out position that was his at Ojai, he would have found it  psychologically painful to bring the implications to the surface. Such  a recognition would have involved a departure from his commitment  not only to Mrs Besant but to himself and place him and his work  in an untenable position, both publicly and privately. He was well  aware of many contradictions in Krishna but had for some years been  convinced of Krishna's friendship toward him. To Raja friendship  assumed a reciprocity of loyalty and affection, too deep and too strong  to require affirmation, and, like Mrs Besant who was herself too truthful  to always perceive the untruth in another, Raja was blinded by his own  high ideals. 
    Rosalind's letters to friends at this time give evidence of the closeness  of the three of them and of the structure of their lives, strange in  conventional terms but evidently not to any of them. I doubt if they  ever wondered what other people thought. But then they didn't have  to because within their own extensive circle they were above reproach  or criticism. To all appearances they were living a charmed life, full  of interesting people, travel and acceptance in any kind of society they  chose. But none of them had the usual attitude toward society. All  three of them were non-conformists and disdained the very idea of  being considered ?(r)respectable'. Indeed Krishna considered the desire  for respectability the prime root of unhappiness.
