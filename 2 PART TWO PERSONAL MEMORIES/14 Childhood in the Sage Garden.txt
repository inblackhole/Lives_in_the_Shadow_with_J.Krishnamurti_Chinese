14 Childhood in the Sage Garden 
    My earliest complete memory is of lying in my crib at Arya Vihara and  smelling smoke. I sensed rather than saw the shape ofa figure through  the window but saw clearly an intermittent red glow like a fire ember. I  was in the front bedroom, my crib near the open screened window, for  it was a warm dark July night. The dining-room seemed a vast distance  away ¡Ð beyond the living-room and the large entrance hall. I could hear  adult voices and above these I called for my mother, who came quickly  as she always did, for [ was not inclined to false alarms. But that night  she did not notice the smell of smoke (she had never had a keen sense of  smell) and thought I was imagining things when I described the glowing  light. I doubt anyone had ever had the effrontery to smoke in front of  Krinsh, so I had probably never encountered a cigarette or cigar. The  next night I called again and this time my mother believed me. The  others belicved neither of us. My mother told me many years later  that she had decided if no one believed us and she became convinced |  was in real danger she would have taken the car and run oft with  me. | suspect both my father and Krinsh would have considered her  hysterical had they known what was going on in her mind. But the  Lindbergh kidnapping only a few years before was still a tragic horror  story in many a young mother's mind and my mother was aware that  in Krinsh's large public there were a few who were not so balanced.  Only one friend, Major Dev Meyers, finally took the trouble to look  under the window, where he found cigar ashes. He watched for several  nights and eventually caught the man, a poor transient with a Peeping 
    Tom record. 
    Aside from that one, my childhood memories are an unchronologically  woven tapestry of lovely places and loving people. The memories of these  people cluster like iron filings around places, without reference to time  and give no more weight to the living than to the dead. 
    Foremost were the Logans, who drove across the country from  Pennsylvania twice a year in a big Packard with a silver owl sitting  proudly on the front. They came for two months in the spring and

    again in the autumn and our lives were closely intertwined. Rosalind  had first met Sara Logan in 1926 in India. Almost immediately they  had developed a very close friendship. 
    Sara always wore flowing white dresses and shawls and had silky  white hair, and penetrating blue eyes softened by a gentle smile.  Robert, or Mr Robbie as we all called him, was more formidable,  at least to a small child. He dressed with exact appropriateness for the  occasion, with knickerbockers and visored cap for golf and hiking,  white ducks for badminton, and velvet trousers and jacket for dinners  at Arya Vihara. Robert and Sara bought the former guest house behind  Arya Vihara with its three or four acres of land and two small cottages.  They called the big house Saro Vihara and furnished it with Indian rugs,  pottery and baskets which they collected each year as they drove through  the reservations. 
    Robert Logan was a direct descendant of James Logan, the Quaker  secretary of Willlam Penn. Ironically James Logan made his fortune  in furs while Robert's father, Sydney Algernon Logan was one of the  founders of the Anti-Vivisection Society, to which he left his fortune.  Robert went even further than his father as an animal benefactor. He  was also a vegetarian and he and Sara campaigned against the use of  leather products or furs. They had found many kindred spirits in the  Theosophical Society, but Robert's ardent pacifism was an ideal passed  down through the Logan Quaker heritage. 
    While Robert in his later years would say that Sara had the type  of beauty that becomes deeper with age, he often liked to describe a  moment in his youth at a d¡§|butante ball in Philadelphia where two of  the most beautiful women he was ever to see were standing as young  d¡§|butantes at the top of the staircase, Carolyn Hastings, a stunning  brunette, and Sara Wetherill, an equally stunning blonde. They could  not have imagined at that moment that they would one day share an  interest in Krishnamurti. 
    Robert was born into circumstances which enabled him never to have  to work, but with his Quaker background he was expected to attain a  profession and at least for a while to prove he could live by it. He and  Sara had once lived in a walk-up, cold-water flat while he practised  law in New York and ate forty cent lunches at Delmonico's. He had  joined the Players' Club and in later years told stories of his encounters  there with the elderly Mark Twain. Eventually they moved to the  nearly two-hundred-acre estate near Philadelphia, which they called  Sarobia and which Sara's father had given them for a wedding present.  Robert gave up the law and became a gentleman farmer and scholar. 
    124

    He also wrote fine poetry, translated the Divine Comedy into beautiful  English, sculpted, and managed his stock portfolios. Eventually both  Sara and Robert turned away from society to pursue a humanitarian and  spiritual path. They also helped to promote artists and actors and, before  their involvement with Krishna, supported a summer stock theatre at  Sarobia. They housed innumerable people in need under their roof,  some elderly and displaced who stayed permanently. 
    Behind the lawns at Arya Vihara was a bricked patio, with a trumpet  vine trellis, tiered rock work, and a rectangular lily pond, all of which  had been given by Sara, who loved to design gardens. She also made  a croquet lawn below the terrace and, although she did not play, she  had a concrete badminton court built on the edge of the orchard. 
    One Easter my mother brought me a small duckling. That it was  missing an oil duct almost led to fatal mishap for both the duck and  me, for it was unable to waterproofits feathers. Every time it went in  the pool it sank. With my three-year-old logic I thought it simply didn't  know how to swim. I persistently tried to keep it afloat. As I couldn't  swim either, it was a good thing that there was always someone around.  The duck and I would both plunge headlong towards the bottom of the  pool. One day Mr Robbie thought he was seeing me trying to drown  the duck for he did not understand about its oil duct problem -indeed  at that moment none of us did. 
    ?(r)I clearly saw her trying to drown the poor thing.' 
    ?(r)Oh no! Radha would never do that. She was trying to save it.'  My mother replied braving his anger in my defence. But no amount  of explaining by my mother as to my motives, which she at least  understood, could assuage his anger at me. Mr Robbie would never  tolerate any kind of cruelty or even thoughtlessness to animals and  in his view children were often the worst offenders and not really  worth knowing until they were taught to be civilized. Perhaps under  the influenice of Sara, he tolerated me better than most and we would  one day love each other very much, but for three days he wouldn't  talk to me or to my mother because of her defence of me. By the  greatest of luck, only a few days later, he read in a magazine about a  missing oil duct in another duck and most graciously apologized. When  it came to squeezing frogs or srogs as I called them, even Mr Robbie  had to recognize that [ was only guilty of an overwhelming love for  these creatures and with great patience he eventually convinced me that  I should show a little less passion toward them. I loved Sara, who unlike  Mr Robbie was never strict and spent a great deal of time entertaining a  small child. Her own daughter, Deborah, who was about my mother's 
    125      age, was tragically separated from Sara and Robert in those years But  that was a story I would learn about later. 
    There were many people around us who had suffered tragedy and  had found comfort and renewal in Krinsh's words. Some understood  that a path starting with doubt and leading to enquiry and search was in  itself the goal; that there was no answer beyond the direct and immediate  individual experience towards which Krinsh in his talks tried to clear  the way. The Logans were among those who had bridged the ravine  between Krinsh and Theosophy, as had my aunt Erma. They seemed  to find no contradiction in the Theosophical precepts of universal  brotherhood, alleviating suffering and Krinsh's view that freedom lay  in an unconditioned mind free of past thoughts, memories and beliefs.  Whether or not they believed in the Masters and the occult areas of  Theosophy they would have found irrelevant to discuss. 
    Much as I loved being with my grandmother in Hollywood and  missed her in my long absences from her, life at Ojai was better. My  cousin David, Grace and Willie's son, lived there. He was just a year  younger than me and we were as close as brother and sister. He spent  most of the time at our house when we were in OQjai. [ have often  wondered what life was like for David when we weren't there, for his  world became so centred around ours. His father Willie managed the  ranch and David and I used to follow him about and ride with him on  the tractor. We were probably a colossal nuisance, but he never made  us feel that. Willie was immensely strong and could easily carry both  of us, each tucked under an arm. No matter how tired he was or how  long his day, his laughter always came easily, bubbling up through his  sturdy chest like clear spring water. 
    Willie Weidemann was the son of Frederick Weidemann, a famous  opera singer in Vienna in the early part of this century. As a young  man Willie often sang in the chorus of the Vienna opera. One of his  brothers followed in the father's footsteps to become an opera singer  himself. But not Willie. He turned against the high living of pre-First  World War Vienna, vowing to himself, and he never broke this vow,  that he would not touch alcohol. He went to Agricultural College in  Denmark, got his degree in grass and grain agronomy and then took  off for America, where he found a job training horses in South Dakota.  Eventually he made his way to Ojai, where he worked with Marvel,  Rosalind's and Grace's older sister, on her chicken ranch. There he first  saw Grace when he helped her from the rumble seat of a car. It was  love at first sight. In time Raja asked him to take charge of the orange  grove at Arya Vihara and the Weidemann family moved there into one 
    126  
 
                   
Childhood in the Sage Garden 
    of the houses on Mr Robbie's land next door. Raja needed Willie's help  in the office as well, and Willie, with his ability to learn anything to  perfection, became not only business manager but Raja's trusted friend  and confidant. 
    Although he was at the core of all of our lives, Willie never had any  interest in the philosophical side of life around Krinsh. He helped in all  the financial and practical matters, the mailing lists, the books, even  sitting behind the table to sell the publications at the talks. He told  me once many years later, after he had retired, that the reason he had  no interest in what Krinsh had to say was because he had witnessed  early on the great discrepancy between what Krinsh said and what he  did. Willie never commented on this to anyone as he did not consider  it his business but quietly made up his mind that he would find his  own path, as he always had ¡Ð and indeed as Krinsh himself publicly  recommended. 
    In those early years neither was I in the least interested in what Krinsh  said publicly. It was a wonder to me how several thousand people could  sit spellbound by his words. His private behaviour was more intriguing.  I also sensed with gratitude that his actions often drew on himself the  attention and the irritation of my parents which might otherwise have  fallen on me. Krinsh's habit of eating only half of everything annoyed  my mother. There were halves of bananas, apples, pieces of biscuits or  toast always left for her to dispose of. Nothing was ever thrown out  or wasted so someone had to be found to eat the other half. 
    My mother too had her own way of being irritating. I think she was  by nature a gambler for she loved to take chances. She was lucky almost  always in the outcome and won at games of luck. Once on an ocean  voyage, Sara had staked her in a bridge game and Rosalind had returned  the stake tenfold. This luck was particularly irritating to my father, who  seemed to have very little luck of his own. He was painfully meticulous  about everything, a trait in itself annoying to some of us, yet he was  constantly plagued by the serious consequences of others' errors while  my mother sailed through such misfortunes without even noticing. Her  luck would show up often in her driving. She certainly would have  deserved some of the tickets she never got although she was always  an excellent driver and never had an accident. She would not allow  enough time for anything but still managed to get it all done and arrive  almost on time (she considered a consistent ten minutes late on time  for her). Krinsh was always consulting his Patek Philippe gold pocket  watch, given him by Mr Robbie, to emphasize her lack of punctuality.  Krinsh was never late for anything (unless it was due to my mother). 
    127  
 
                   
 
    Dish washing was often a cause of considerable contention between her  and Krinsh. First she stacked and balanced the dishes in the sink in such  a way that they should have inevitably toppled over ¡Ð but never did,  a habit we attributed to her gambling spirit. She then rushed through  the washing in a slap-dash fashion while Krinsh and I dried. He would  search for particles of food and hand back the plate. Irritation increased  on both sides and the whole routine became underlined by excited,  half-joking half-angry chatter. My father had long since departed for  his office. He felt no obligation whatsoever to join in this particular  chore and looked on such skirmishes as intolerably petty. 
    His causes for irritation with Krinsh seemed, even to me, more  serious. Krinsh loved to promise things to people. He could never say  no to a request. Sometimes he would even offer to loan money. Of  course he had no cash and no bank account either. I doubt if he ever  wrote a cheque in his life. Krinsh had no concept of money. A thousand  dollars meant no more than twenty. My father would then either have to  write the cheque or explain to the supplicant that there were no funds for  loans. Even I realized that money was scarce throughout my childhood.  My mother ran the household on a strict budget, made all my clothes  and Krinsh's and my father's shirts and pyjamas. I learned very young  that it-was best never to ask for anything, but neither did I feel the  need to do so. Life at Arya Vihara was fun. We didn't need toys or  expensive diversions. 
    Mary Gray's School of the Open Gate was still next door to Arya  Vihara, although Erma no longer had anything to do with it. David  and I both went there, but my attendance must have been somewhat  irregular with all the travelling we did in those days. It was Krinsh  who usually got me ready for school and taught me how to tie my  shoelaces in the English schoolboy manner, with one end looped under  so they never came undone. We also polished our shoes together every  afternoon before dinner. In spite of all this emphasis on shoes, I never  really liked them and as soon as [ had a choice wore sandals or went  barefoot. Krinsh himself usually wore his Indian sandals or sneakers  around Arya Vihara. When [ was very small he called me Tum-Tums.  Happily he modified this to Kittums by the time it mattered and it  remained that ever after. He made an earnest effort to share with me his  interest in learning languages and we would have a regular half-hour  of French Linguaphone records every morning before school. He was  not a good language teacher for he failed to give me any indication  of whether my pronunciation was improving. He would only say, ?(r)No,  no, not like that,?¡À and the lesson would end with a tolerant smile that 
    128  
 
                   
 
  Childhood in the Sage Garden 
    was far from encouraging. The same method was applied to my yoga  lessons and I have found both these disciplines particularly difficult ever  since. But of all my adults Krinsh was definitely the most fun. He was  never cross or strict, always loving and usually willing to play. 
    Arya Vihara was its own island; we never heard what the rest of  QOjai thought of it. But there must have been those who wondered  who we were and what we were up to. We were not even part of  the Theosophical community, which Krinsh firmly eschewed in those  days. But nothing about our life seemed peculiar to me, even later  when some of my school friends hinted that it was. Of course, in  the early days most of my companions were the children of Krinsh's  followers so I had no problems. He always joined David and me and  our friends on the lawn for hide and seek. I was very proud to say that  as well as a Mummy and Daddy I had a Krinsh, which was something  no one else seemed to have. 
    Wild animals played a frequent part in our life. One day Krinsh  brought home three baby opossums whose mother had been killed by  a car. We fed them with a medicine dropper and they hung by their  tails from the wire cage top, in time growing large enough to send  on their own way in the world. I realized that wild animals were only  visitors and not permanent members of our household, but I became  keenly attached to them nevertheless. We once found a baby skunk in  the garden and it became a pet for many weeks; more affectionate than  our cat, 1t snuggled against my neck and I loved it, odour and all. One  morning it was gone from its little house set on an earth bed in the patio.  The skunk odour was strong around the house all night. We could see  the traces of its tiny feet digging from the inside and the large marks of  its mother's feet digging from the outside to reclaim her lost baby. 
    My father loved animals but he was also very fastidious and did not  enjoy my little ducklings running over his bed or a puppy wetting his  office rug. Only then did I encounter the irritation that he sometimes  turned on Krinsh, yet I was never intimidated by him, for there was a  reasonableness in his anger and it always subsided as soon as the cause  for it was removed. 
    There were constant visitors. One who had a very special place in  our lives for over fifty years was Blanche Matthias. She was a fine  poet, an art critic, and had a great talent for bringing together good  combinations of people. She extended her warmth and generosity to  three generations of our family. Blanche had been introduced to Krinsh  before I was born by Mima Porter, the eldest de Manziarly sister, who  was now the widow of an American. She was the only one of the de 
    129  
 
                   
 
    Manziarlys to marry. Blanche wrote her recollections about this first  meeting with Krinsh: 
    My friend led me through a large citrus grove, past a good-sized  house, to a small one-room ?(r)shack'. I was asked to remove my shoes,  and leaving them outside I went alone into the shaded room. Waiting  there, sitting quietly on the floor, was the most beautiful being I had  ever seen. He was as shy as I was and I do not remember one word  of our conversation or if we spoke at all. 
    I left him with the certainty that there was something in life I had  not suspected. Something other than writing and music and art - something other than Christianity and white skins.! 
    It was Blanche who initiated a series of summers in Carmel. There 
    she introduced us (really Krinsh) to her friends; the poet Robinson 
    Jeffers, the writer Erskine Scott Wood and, the photographer Edward  Weston among others. Blanche also arranged and provided for our  accommodation.  On 17 July 1934 Rosalind wrote: 
    Darling Blanche, 
    Yesterday we all decided considering many things that if it would  really suit your convenience we would rather come to Carmel in  September . . . Krishnaji thinks Raja should have a month free from  work first so that his mind will be fresh for the book they are going  to do in Carmel. 
    .. . As to rooms: you are all much too kind in your arrangements  but we do not really need so many rooms. If Krishnaji has his bedroom  and one other room where they can work we thought it would be  better if we were all together in the hotel ¡Ð otherwise I could never  be with them and help them if the baby were alone, asleep, etc. So  ifI could have a room for baby and me, Raja a room, it would be  perfect. Please do not do this if it means turning anyone out of the  hotel . . . 
    Much love from us both,  ROSALIND 
    The hotel referred to was Peter Pan Lodge in the Carmel Highlands  which, unhappily for the many who loved it, burned down about thirty  years ago. We were to spend many summers there. 
    Rosalind could not have known when she wrote this letter that her

    and Krishna's rooms would be adjacent, each with its own little balcony 
    and that Krishna would take the tremendous risk of jumping Errol Flynn 
    style between the two to come into her room at night. 
    In view of this, his apparent concern for Raja being rested and in good  frame of mind to help with the book shows how comfortably Krishna  situated himself in the middle of that marriage. He also displayed a  father's protective instinct toward Raja's baby. One night carrying me  down the stairs at the Lodge, Krinsh slipped and fell and everyone  present noticed, and commented for years after, how he protected me  at any cost to himself. 
    Vivid memories of Carmel still linger; Peter Pan Lodge and Wendy  who ran it ¡Ð Tinkerbell the cat, the seagull with a broken wing that we  tried to repair. Every night there was clear potassium broth for dinner  with a bit of parsley floating in it and iced celery and carrot sticks. I  don't remember what came after, but undoubtedly they went to great  pains to provide good vegetarian fare. 
    It was very much Krinsh's and my mother's time together. I can see  him sitting on the edge of her bed and massaging cold cream on to her  face. She always dressed well and carefully and took care of her face and  hair, but had she not done so he would certainly have seen to it that she  did. He must have been very strong for he carried me everywhere when  I got tired of scrambling after them over the rocky points and tide pools  of Point Lobos and the pine-sheltered trails on the hill behind Peter Pan.  Where my father was on these occasions I do not know. He is not part  of my memories in Carmel. Those summers that he came there with  us, he must have spent mostly in his room working on manuscripts.  It would have been uncharacteristic of him to accompany Krinsh, my  mother and me on our walks. Evenings, too, he would have been  working alone in his room after they all retired and early mornings he  would, as was his custom, sleep late having been up working half the  night. It is Krinsh that I remember vividly, laughing often, particularly  when he was with my mother. Our world then seemed flooded with  joy and gentleness ¡Ð and love.
