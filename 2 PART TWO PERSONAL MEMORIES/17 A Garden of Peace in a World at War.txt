17 A Garden of Peaceina World at War 
    Krinsh was by far the most rewarding person to play pranks on. The  sour lime tree in the orchard bore fruit with juice that looked exactly  like the juice of an orange. Whenever I served this to Krinsh for breakfast  he gave a wonderful performance of surprise and shock. Putting frogs in  his bed met with equal success. The row of acacias leading from Arya  Vihara to Pine Cottage was on a route travelled by Krinsh at regular  intervals throughout the day. As he was a person of precise routinc it  was easy for me and my cousin David to know just when to hide in  a tree with a small pail of water ready to dump on his head. He never  scolded us for inflicting this considerable inconvenience on him and he  never failed us in reacting exactly as we hoped he would, sometimes  pretending he knew just where we were, holding his large straw hat  over his head and running -only to have guessed wrong. 
    That the peculiarities of our family did not make me in the least  self-conscious was due largely to my mother. She had a way of making  things turn out for the best, at least where I was concerned. When [  mentioned once that all my friends had turkeys at Thanksgiving time  and why didn't we, she came home one day with a pair of turkey chicks.  It didn't occur to me until much later that this was not the usual way to  serve up turkey. By dubious fortune the chicks grew into a male and a  female and when the time was right Mrs Turkey devoted a great deal  of effort to egg laying. Even the gobbler became distraught by her  obsession with sitting on endless batches of eggs. Finally he turned to  me for comfort. The huge bird, who weighed as much as I did, would  hop on to my lap and put his strange wattled head on my shoulder.  Indeed he so loyally attached himself to me that he slept on the railing  at the top of the outside stairs by my room and no one dared to go up  there without his permission. 
    When at length his forty offspring grew to full size the whole flock 
    would join us on our afternoon walks up the road toward Thacher 
    School; bad luck for any of the few cars that wanted to use the road 
    at that hour. There were heavy rains that winter and in one storm the 
    167  
 
                   
 
    bridge at the bottom of the road washed out and the one above us was  about to go. If that happened we would be cut off from the village.  There was a good deal of concern among the adults; the turkeys and 
    joined them near the bridge watching the water rampage over the  boulders and eat away at the pilings. The turkeys tilted their heads and  peered over the bank with amazement. 
    My friends came to watch our turkeys, whose favourite pastime was  tobogganing down the back of the Lincoln Zephyr, which was moulded  in one sleek slope from roof to bumper. If Krinsh felt annoyed that his  regular polishing and care of the car was futile, he never showed it.  After the next Thanksgiving had come and gone our turkeys were still  happily running around the garden. 
    When I was very young [ was spared the uglier of life's realities. One  summer we departed for our usual stay in Carmel. On our return to  Ojai all the young turkeys had gone. I sensed it would be a mistake  to insist on knowing what had happened to them. I was told they  had gone away as there was no one at home to look after them. It  was Willie, of course, who always dealt with that side of life, usually  sparing everyone else the details; however, I had heard him grumble  occasionally when Mr Robbie complained about the gopher traps. ?(r)You  can't have it both ways, if you want a good orchard, you have to get rid  of the pests.?А└ Not long after that, coyotes made off with Mrs Turkey  and my gobbler. That was my next loss after Sara, and as all children  in time must do, I was beginning to learn that grief is an inevitable  part of life. 
    Happily two goslings followed quickly on the disappearance of the  turkeys and soon grew into two enormous geese. Eggs began app- earing, fortunately from them both, so we were spared the problem  of any more gaggles of fowl. The eggs made delicious omelettes and  the geese seemed happy not to have to spend their time sitting on  them. Instead they became fierce guardians and attacked all those  they disliked, though their idea of friend or foe was never clear to  us. They particularly disliked ladies in stockings. I am sure there  were those who felt they were failing in their spiritual advancement  if geese so closely associated with Krinsh picked on them with such  outraged contempt. 
    My grandmother's health was failing in 1939 and Rosalind made frequent  trips to Hollywood to help Erma take care of her. Krinsh then became  my guardian as well as playmate, seeing that I ate properly, dressed  neatly for school, and showed responsibility for the animals. He was 
    168  
 
                   
A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    always protective and I felt completely safe with him, but David and  I often took advantage of his indulgence toward us. 
    Dearest Mummy, 
    The other day Krinsh and Davit and T all took a little walk and 
    found a dead snake on the road. We wanted to take it home. But we 
    did not want to carry that smelly thing all the way home so Krinsh 
    said that he would and when we got home we put the snake in the 
    garage and when Grace came down to bring the paper she saw the 
    snake. Then she began to scrime for she thought it was alive . . . 
    No doubt it was again Willie who had to dispose of the smelly snake. 
    But when it came to thought, Krinsh was another person. The gentle  easy-going nature disappeared and he could be as fierce with me, if I  asked or said something he thought stupid, as he was with his audiences  in the Oak Grove or at the small Sunday discussion groups at Arya  Vihara. 1 tried hard not to arouse this side of him for I found it  most discomforting and felt tender pity for those poor questioners  who recklessly laid themselves open to his scorn and impatience by  asking stupid questions. The pained look on his face should have been  enough to quell curiosity in the most determined seeker of truth, yet  they tried again and again. ?(r)What about life after death, reincarnation,  and belief (or disbelief) in an ultimate reality??А└ Imagine when I came  along and asked if he believed in fairies like our Finnish cook did! 
    ?(r)That', he said, ?(r)is like the three blind men and the elephant. The one  who feels the trunk claims it is a tree, the one who feels the tail claims  it 1s a rope =' 
    I don't remember what the third claimed but I got the point and  never dared ask the next question foremost in my mind Ал did he believe  in Santa Claus? In time, as I grew older I realized that the very word  belief was not a question of what but of why. Why we wanted to believe  anything revealed our own psychology. It was important to observe and  experience; ourselves as well as the world around us, without labelling  or judging. Neither had Krinsh any regard for an accumulation of facts  or knowledge and ifI had been solely under his influence I would have  considered education a colossal waste of time. 
    Either for better or worse there were other influences on me. My  father taught me to read and write and do arithmetic and geography  long before I went to school and I treasured these times with him. Erma  came up from Hollywood almost every weekend and she taught me to  love books, history and nature. David and I would walk in the Ojai 
    169  
 
                   
 
    hills with her and learn the names of all the sages and grasses and rock  formations. She had a lovely singing voice; as a little girl I always wanted  her to sing me to sleep. Erma said of herself that she was an observer.  She never sought to be the centre of any situation but was content to  watch without criticism the goings on around her. | have never met  anyone who was more of a joy to be with than Ermie. Capable of  profound philosophical discussions, she also had a delightful sense of  humour. Krinsh called her Sister Erma, a pleasant familiarity that she  enjoyed. She was always different in her political views from the rest  of my adults, more conservative, and stood up to them very well with  her arguments, even against Krinsh, for she knew a considerable amount  of history which she had taught herself. Erma, like Sara, was one of  those rare women who grow more and more beautiful with age. 
    And then there were the Huxleys. Aldous and Maria came to Ojai  frequently. Even though Aldous was blind in one eye and could see  very little in the other, the intensity of his interest made him seem to  have keener sight than those of us with perfect vision. He was never  overbearing with his knowledge and with childlike delight Ал like Krinsh 
    Ал he would squat down on the grass with me and play with the geese  (which he named Toddleiums and Susielums, names soon reduced to  Toby and Susie by Mr Robbie. (The fact that Toby was a lady goose  was disregarded.) I was too young to be in awe of Aldous. I have a clear  vision of him, on those weekends, sitting on the lower lawn under the  large pine tree, typing a book. First, After Many a Summer Dies the Swan,  one of whose characters he said was loosely based on my mother, but he  would not tell her which, although he seemed surprised that she didn't  recognize herself. When he asked her how she liked the book she said,  ?(r)Aldous, I'm sorry but I can't honestly say I liked it.?А└ ?(r)Good,' he said,  ?(r)it was not supposed to be liked.'  Maria had a little Pomeranian called LouLou that went nearly every- where with her. She was not altogether an animal person, being of  the same super-fastidious nature as my father. Yet it was she who one  Easter, when we went to tea at their home in Los Angeles, presented  me with a baby goat. My mother took this unusual gift in her stride  and we took the goat back to Ojai, where eventually it was my job to  milk it, although it was never my favourite animal. Aldous shared our  family's love for animals and he and Maria had both become vegetarians  since their arrival in America. This was a bond between us all, as was an  affinity for nature Ал particularly in Krinsh and Aldous. On their long  walks they would observe together, Aldous knowing all the names in  Latin and English of flowers, shrubs and butterflies. Krinsh, generally 
    170  
 
                         A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    disapproving of labels, but seemingly fascinated by Aldous's ability.  Their minds approached nature from such opposite paths and yet they  found harmony in each other's company. Aldous quoted a German  philosopher who once said the greatest joy is to pick your nose while  watching the sunset; Krinsh would say just watch, don't remark on it  or try to hold the beauty in your memory or it will be lost instantly. 
    loved going to the Huxleys. Something exciting always happened  around them. Once a rather mixed group of us including Bertrand Russell  with his sons, Aldous and Maria with their son, various Hollywood  personalities, plus Krinsh all went for a walk in what was then the back  country Ал the hills of Los Angeles. Signs were posted everywhere against  smoking or fires and we were all scrambling illegally under barbed wire  fences, crossing private land and defying ?(r)no trespassing' signs. That  was all right but then the Russells all started smoking. That was not  all right, even with Aldous who understood by then the hazards of  our California dry season. But nothing deterred them Ал~ until a deputy  sheriff appeared with a drawn gun and was ready to arrest the lot of  us. ?(r)Sure and I'm Bob Hope,?А└ he said when someone tried to explain  that none of us were criminals, in fact ?(r)There is a famous writer, there  a famous actress, and there a famous philosopher' Ал however he let us  go after a good scolding about the cigarettes. 
    Dinners at Arya Vihara, even when we no longer had a cook and my  mother had to do everything herself, were formal in comparison to the  rest of the day. I can still picture my mother, in a long dress she had  made of Indian silk, at one end of the table with Krinsh at the other  end in a curved high-backed chair. When Mr Robbie or Aldous was  present, she gave up her place to him with Krinsh always sitting at the  far end. [ never remember my father sitting at cither end. 
    Everyone, even Krinsh, deferred to Mr Robbie. There was something  beyond his age that inspired this. After dinner we played poker dice with  Mr Robbie's beautiful Chinese eight-sided ivory dice or Monopoly, at  which my mother excelled. Even Krinsh played occasionally, always  looking a bit pained, but I am sure he would not have played if he  had not enjoyed it, for he never did anything he didn't really want  to do. In her autobiography, Beato described those evenings and how  they struck some people not in our immediate household. 
    Friends in Hollywood were excited whenever | went to Arya Vihara  and asked me to listen carefully to everything Krishnamurti said so  that I could report back to them. At first [ went to Ojai expecting to 
    171      hear talk of ?(r)higher' matters, and was surprised to hear conversations  that revolved around Rosalind's vegetable garden and the cow . . . 
    I longed to discuss such things as the third aspect of the Logos,  or the coming of the Sixth Root Race; but conversations usually  dealt with human affairs and the activities were unpretentious and  ordinary. In fact, everyone loved games, especially Monopoly. One  night Rosalind, who was a real shark at real estate, got everybody's  holdings and even bankrupted Krishnamurti. I sat there paralyzed  with boredom when Krishamurti, catching my distant gaze, suddenly  threw up his hands and said: ?(r)Beatrice has no idea what this is about  and never will. Don't bother with her anymore.?А└ I was enormously  relieved to withdraw myself from the encounter, which went on for  three more hours!! 
    It was seldom that Krinsh became involved enough to stick out a  game that long. He most enjoyed games which required no thinking  whatsoever. He would never have dreamed of playing chess. Most  often, promptly at nine o'clock, he would leave for his cottage after  having pulled out and carefully consulted his Patek Philippe. 
    Mr Robbie had a Patek Philippe also and he and Krinsh compared  their watches daily to the second. They tuned in to the government  time service in Virginia every Sunday on my father's short-wave radio.  I used to wonder how, in our kind of life, the exact time could matter  so much. I could see where the second hand was important to Krinsh  in his Yoga breathing exercises but not the hour hand. Perhaps perfect  punctuality was a remnant of Leadbeater's upbringing. 
    Although my upbringing seemed strict to me in comparison to that  of my friends, this strictness applied more to behaviour than activities.  There were relatively few activities in that time and place that could  lead to serious trouble. In the eyes of all of my parents, lying was the  worse offence Ал no other misdemeanour could equal it; it was always  better to tell the truth and take the consequences. I interpreted this to  mean that I did not have to volunteer confessions that were not asked  for. Probably the naughtiest thing (and the most dangerous) that David  and I and an occasional friend did was to swim in the reservoirs on the  adjacent ranches. These wonderful large pools of only slightly slimy  green water nestled in the foothills and were used for irrigation. The  slippery sloping sides could be treacherous when little wet feet tried to  climb back out and drowning was not at all an unlikely possibility. None  of these dangers, of course, meant a thing on a hot summer day. One of  my earliest disillusionments came when I confided one day to Krinsh Ал 
    172  
 
                         A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    only after he had crossed his heart and hoped to die if he betrayed our  secret Ал that we had swum in the reservoir, although one at a time so  that the other two could help the swimmer out by lowering down a  pair of blue jeans to grasp hold of. We had thought this eminently  sensible and above criticism, at least from him who appeared to be  always on our side in our pranks. He did even then seem to be on  our side and offered not even the mildest scolding. I shall never forget  my overwhelming sense of betrayal when my mother called me in and  confronted me with this escapade, admitting that Krinsh had told her.  At that moment I lost my trust in him. I did not wonder then why he  had chosen to break his word rather than to take an adult stance and  deal with this small matter of discipline himself. He might casily have  explained that the situation was far too dangerous to indulge in childish  secrets and that he must be sure I would never do it again. I am sure  I would have disliked this approach but it would have preserved my  confidence in him. I was never to trust him with a secret again or  with any small personal problem that arose in pressing urgency in my  adolescent years. From then on [ went to the person [ would always  look to in serious moments Ал my father. 
    In September 1939 Raja returned from Europe, after stopping in Detroit  on the way to California to pick up a sporty Cadillac convertible. His  new car was received by Krishna and Rosalind with no more enthusiasm  than his driving. Krishna displayed the same contemptuous reaction  as in 1924, when Raja turned up with a Buick. Rosalind felt it was  inappropriate for Raja to own a Cadillac. As it had been stripped of  its paint by a sandstorm while crossing the desert, Raja was persuaded  to turn it in, for a blue Ford CoupАД|. 
    Before leaving Holland Raja had desperately urged his Dutch friends  to emigrate to America. He was convinced by what he had seen on  a side trip to Germany that as soon as the bumper German crop  was harvested, Hitler would turn westward and eventually march on  Holland. Only one family, the Vigevenos, believed him and with their  three children and valuable art collection, left everything else behind and  sailed on what was to be the last boat to America. After the war Annie  Vigeveno would learn that forty of her German relatives had died in  concentration camps. 
    I was shielded from most of the horrors of the war. My mother  saw to it that I heard none of the news broadcasts that Krinsh and  my father listened to every night. Fearing that the future held grave  uncertainty, she wanted my childhood to be normal and happy for 
    173  
 
                   
 
   
    as long as possible. At the same time I was encouraged to be aware  of individual misfortune. There were plenty of people around us who  had suffered from the war long before America's involvement. 
    One day while we were in Hollywood, I was invited by myself  to the Ingelmans' for lunch. There I met another guest, a large and  very morose French painter called Guy Ignon. I learned that he was a  refugee from France who had jumped ship in New York and swum  ashore, miraculously making his way to the West Coast. John and  Hilda Ingelman were trying to help him get papers and work, for he  was practically starving. Gloomy as he was, I took an instant liking  to him or perhaps felt it was in the tradition of our family to invite  such a person home to tea, which I did. He may have been somewhat  surprised at a very formally presented invitation from a nine-year-old  girl, but he did show up the next afternoon and my parents took him on.  They introduced him to the Vigevenos who, though recent immigrants  themselves, had already established a successful art gallery in West Los  Angeles. Ignon's fortunes changed from then on and he always looked  on me as his little mascot. He painted my portrait, which my mother  bought although she never liked it, for Ignon had painted me with  enormous eyes holding all the suffering in his own heart and more  besides. Even after he married a lovely young wife and had a son, he  still looked morose. 
    In spring 1940 my grandmother Sophia died. She had just undergone a  successful gall bladder operation and was recovering well in the hospital  when her doctor went off duty and forgot to warn the staft that she was  fatally allergic to certain medicines. When these were inadvertently given  to her, she instantly declined. With the doctor's permission, Rosalind  took her home to Gower Street, where she and Erma nursed her until  her death a few weeks later. During this time Aldous and Maria came  every morning and sat quietly in the living-room, not expecting to visit  or talk but just giving her their quiet support. 
    Erma describes this time in her diary: 
    We are really going through a great experience, and Theosophically  speaking, Mother must have some pretty good karma since she looks  very beautiful in her fading gradually and when the release comes she  will have doubtless been separated from all the denser matter and be  fully released just as we would all like to be. Dr Norris seems very  pleased with Rosalind and me for the way we are taking care of her,  since she is kept immaculately clean Ал and we have established a quiet 
    174  
 
                         A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    peace in the house, it is almost like a sanctuary now, so all is well in  accordance with our beliefs Ал if we may call our ideas that. 
    Erma always managed to balance gracefully between Theosophy and  Krinsh. 
    I was at school in Ojai the day my grandmother died. I remember  suddenly putting my head down on my desk and knowing she was  gone. When my mother came to tell me I said I already knew. I felt  her loss keenly for in her last years my grandmother had put her whole  focus on me and given me, among other things, her love of music.  After her death Christmastime was never again the special occasion  it had been while she was alive, for it was the one time of year she  came to Ojai. My mother and I, David, my aunts and Willie would  stand around the piano, which my grandmother still played beautifully  despite the arthritis in her hands, and would sing Christmas carols. My  grandmother sometimes inspired Willie to sing ?АсThe Ode to Joy' from  Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, remembered from his youth when he  sang in the chorus of the Vienna Opera. Of course, Erma's lovely  contralto added much to these occasions. I had heard of the musical  evenings in Buffalo and, despite the richness of interests and people  in our lives, I still missed being part of a musical world. It was  gone completely when my grandmother died. No one could play the  piano. Krinsh disliked the very idea of Christmas and made us all quite  uncomfortable about it; and all the underlying tensions in our house  seemed to be squeezed to the surface by this now empty celebration. 
    But what Krinsh lacked in Christmas spirit he made up for in small  daily rituals; the early morning flowers for my mother and the single  beautiful rose, fragrant with morning dew, on her birthdays. He told  me one should never smell a lower before it 1s given in order not to  detract anything from it. 
    Robert, sensing Rosalind's fatigue after Sophia's death, wrote to her  in May 1940. 
    [ am adding $100 to the check so that you and Radha can go to Sequoia 
    or Yosemite or somewhere for a couple of weeks of change and rest; 
    you certainly need it and must have it. 
    With much love, 
    ROBERT 
    My father also recognized how tired she was; in June he took us to  Sequoia National Park, in the High Sierras, in his Ford. As we entered  the park we saw a bear in the middle of the road. To my surprise and 
    175  
 
                   
 
    my father's distress, when I offered her a piece of chewing gum, she  showed her lack of appreciation by leaving a deep claw mark on the  running board. The wild park animals in those days had not yet been  spoiled by human beings, although feeding bears was forbidden as we  were soon told. This was the beginning of annual summer treks to  Sequoia, which continued through the war years. 
    In 1940 an early autumn gathering had been planned at Sarobia. My  mother went with Krinsh, this time leaving me in Ojai as I was about  to start attending the private and progressive Ojai Valley School. My  father was left alone in charge of me with Mrs Kaarna, our cook. It  was a happy time for me, but must have been hard for him. 
    Shortly after her return to California Rosalind wrote to Blanche: 
    Dearest Blanche,  Raja looks thin and tired as he is working hard . . . Since being home  I have had Radha three weeks in bed with the flu and [ have never seen  her so ill before. It is the first time I have ever had to call a doctor in  for her. Over six hundred people in Ojai had the flu. Krishnaji was  in bed a week with a slight bronchial disturbance and I have never  seen him in bed for over a day or so before. They are perfectly well  again and chipper than ever . . . 
    Rosalind's comment about Krishna's health is interesting in view of  the continual health problems he was said to have in his earlier days.  Actually he was very sound in those years and almost never caught colds  or flu, suffering only from allergies that caused some minor swelling  around his eyes and occasional coughing. 
    One day while my mother and Krinsh were still at Sarobia I looked out of  the dining-room window, which opened on to a long verandah running  the full length of the house. There I saw pacing up and down, a giant. |  ran to Mrs Kaarna who, since she believed in fairies should know if this  were indeed a giant. We called my father who let him in and discovered  that he was only the very tall husband of Iris Tree. Iris, along with this  husband, Count Frederick Ledebur, her son Christian and the whole  Chekhov troupe of actors who came with her to Ojai (many of them  pacifists, like Iris), would add a new dimension to our lives, particularly  my mother's and mine. They became a part of our lives separate from  Krinsh (who always acted slightly disapprovingly of Iris). Although Iris,  like the rest of our greater circle, faithfully attended his talks, Krinsh was  not the reason that Iris and her crowd had settled in Ojai. They had their  own very full and colourful lives and soon started a repertory theatre. 
    176  
 
                         A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    Familiar as we were with Hollywood, live theatre was for me a new  and wonderful experience. Iris Tree had been born to it. Her father,  Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree was knighted for his greatness as an actor  and was particularly famous for his portrayal of Malvolio in Twelfth  Night. Queen Victoria, as she touched her sword to his shoulder, had  repeated the lines from that play: ?(r)Some are born great, some achieve  greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.?А└ Thanks to the  Chekhov players, Ojai would be favoured for many years with first-rate  performances of Shakespeare, Chekhov, and many other classic plays.  Iris would also give wonderful parties, to which Charlie Chaplin and  other movie actors came. 
    Maria and Aldous had been old friends of Iris's in England and  had sent her to see us when she thought of settling in California. In  Rosalind's absence, it fell to Raja to help Iris. He had already disrupted  his usual routine to take care of me but, as we can see from the following  letter, he found time to effectively help Iris. It was typical of him to take  considerable pains in such instances, in ways of which few people were  ever aware. 
    Dear Mr Rajagopal, 
    It was so kind of you to have taken such trouble about me and 
    the house and I am most grateful Ал 
    Please forgive me for having bothered you with it all when you 
    are so busy with many things. But I loved the place and was relieved 
    to get settled with the boy there Ал always, having set one's heart, it 
    is hard to turn it away again . . . perhaps Mrs Grey (sic) will soften 
    about the dog. It was a great pleasure to have met you and I thank 
    you for all your hospitality and courtesy . . . 
    : -Yours sincerely, 
    IRIS TREE 
    Iris had fine blonde hair cut in a page-boy style which she rinsed  with carrot juice to preserve its colour. She had large violet eyes  and a mischievous smile. She could mimic anything from an egret  to Maria Huxley's charming, heavily inflected Belgian accent. Iris  never mimicked people to their faces, as she said that would make  them self-conscious. Neither did she ever mimic Krinsh in front of  us, although I suspect she often had a good time over that too. 
    While my father enjoyed her company he found her extremely  unfastidious habits distressing. He was once prevailed upon by my  mother to give Iris a ride back to Ojai from Los Angeles. She often  travelled with an array of animals. He met her on the designated street 
    177      corner never suspecting, until it was too late, that he would also have  to transport a large Nubian goat in the jump seat of his tiny, pristine  Ford CoupАД|. 
    Iris was a creative cook and willing to serve up delicious vegetarian  fare, but her kitchen left something to be desired. Displayed in casual  array on the shelves and counters were open cans of cat and dog food,  paint, unwashed dishes and Iris's latest poem. At one dinner my father  found himself half-way through his spaghetti, which he had been politely  swallowing in spite ofa bitterness that he could not identify. Suddenly,  Iris remarked with a hearty laugh that she must have used linseed oil as  she was refinishing her desk and had poured it into the olive oil bottle.  It was some time before he could be prevailed upon to return there for  dinner. 
    Iris generously gave me a puppy from the litter of her rare and  beautiful white German shepherds. This was to comfort me for the  loss of my first dog Jerry-bo, given by Maria and named by Aldous.  Jerry-bo had run off and disappeared while we were living in Molly  Berkeley's house. 
    My pets were still a perpetual problem; trips to either Sequoia, Santa  Barbara or Hollywood made care of them difficult, although geese,  ducks, possums, skunks and chipmunks had all proved easier to handle  than a dog. Aldous named the German shepherd puppy Babs (after  Elizabeth Barrett Browning). When barely full grown, she ran on to  the road in front of Arya Vihara and was hit by a motor-cycle. My  screams and her howls of pain brought Krinsh and my mother running.  Krinsh then demonstrated his own considerable physical courage and  fortitude, for he allowed the poor dog to comfort itself by gnawing  on his fist. Babs.,was taken to the pet hospital and put into a traction  harness in the hope of restoring the use of her back legs. As always at  such moments, Mr Robbie offered to help. 
    June 1st, 1941 
    Dearest Rozzie, 
    The extra $75 on the enclosed check is to help out . . . with the 
    Sequoia cabins or with the hospital expenses for Babs or whatever 
    you think best. 
    Please write once in a while and let me know how you all are and 
    about poor Babs and Krishnaji's visa etc, etc. After all, you know, 
    you are about the only ?(r)family' I have left. 
    Much love,

A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    (One of the persistent problems that Raja had throughout the war 
    years was renewing Krishna's visa which he did successfully, though 
    sometimes needing some influential help.)  Krishna, my mother and I went off to Sequoia as usual that summer, 
    as Babs would be confined to the hospital for some time. Iris followed 
    us with her entourage soon after writing this letter: 
    Ojai 17.V1.41 
    Dearest Rosalind, 
    Late night in our valley, just home. The rivers are drying up and  the green is burning, but there are still flowers on my estate and geese  in yours. I think of you all with joy, Hollywood was Babylon and  ?(r)deletante living'?А└ without thought or love. 
    Party at Marion Davis in the gold and white Versaille they built  for her on sand . . . poor little milkmaid, calling her guests in like  cows to the stable, does she care if she is watched by Greuzes and  Gainsboroughs? Champagne, Venetian goblets, gossip, decay and  furtive terror with the waves beating so near Ал But who am I to  preach, for there I sat enjoying my superior feelings . . . ah well 
    . what else? Ал Earl Carrols vanities. Ninety naked ladies of exactly  the same pattern in patriotic brassieres, smiling and kicking in perfect  time to a deafening orchestra while the audiance watches and eats and  drinks at the same time. So there is progress . . . whatelse? . . . nothing  beautiful or gay? yes, the Gipsies, the fiddle, that forgives everything 
    . what an exquisite instrument, what companionship between it  and the player and the listener what concentration set free into what  ease and joy Ал 
    I have no fiddle and the typewriter wont spell. This is the season  of thc ants. 
    On saturday maybe I shall go look for you in the big trees, bringing  Boon and the dogs and so much love. Please don't have gone and  don't be disturbed and at the same time don't have forgotten me  ... I hope you like it all and are happy. If you see a cabin please  tell it to wait. 
    Yours,  IRIS 
    P.S. Babs is a little better.  The arrival of Iris and her family was a welcome change for me. Now  instead of playing by myself all morning, reading or feeding chipmunks  and deer, I had friends who would take me along on their horseback 
    179  
 
                             rides, make lovely camp-fire picnics with Iris's antics and mimics and  pantomimes for entertainment. And there was her son Chris (Boon),  older than me, but never showing impatience at being trailed after by  a pigtailed ten year old. : 
    There were also, each summer, one or more devotees; single ladies  who discreetly took a cabin far from us and were content to get one  daily glimpse of Krinsh as he walked to the village for the mail. Peeking  from under his large straw hat, I could see he knew they were there  watching, but he never acknowledged them for he was supposed to  be in retreat. For Iris and the Huxleys and certain friends ?(r)retreat' was  modified, although no one ever dared be quite as funny or naughty  when Krinsh was around, even Iris. 
    After we had gone back to Ojai, Iris stayed on and wrote: 
    Goodbye and greetings to you Ал come back soon to the trees Ал they  are dark now, full of shadows and bears and its a bit homeless in our  village of one-night-cabins all about to start down hill Ал 
    How 1s it in the valley and what did you take down with you?  -you left a lot up here Ал food and tasks and many things not on  the list - 
   Come back to the rivers Ал  Come back to the meadows  they will spring green again,  leap again Ал flower, faun,  waterfall Ал come  back to the trees,  light silence, murmuring bird Ал  But wherever you are  it all goes with you Ал  from the tops of the hills Ал whether you  come back or not Ал and  love from us. 
    IRIS 
    When we returned to Ojai we found poor Babs had not improved, but  she quietly died before the decision had to be made to put her down. 
    Before there was any certainty of America entering the war, Rosalind  had arranged with a friend in England to send over thirty British orphans  whom she planned to care for at the unused Star camp buildings until the 
    180  
 
                         A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    war was over. Just how was not totally laid out, but would have been  dealt with no doubt with her usual practicality. At the last minute, with  the orphans nearly aboard and papers and sailing all arranged for, the  British government cancelled the project, deciding the voyage would  be more hazardous for the children than remaining in England. Rosalind  then diverted her efforts to producing food for our household and a good  part of our immediate community of friends and fellow pacifists so, as  much as possible, to be self-supporting and no burden on the world's  food supply. 
    Life soon became nothing but heavy work, particularly for my  mother, with Krinsh and me helping a great deal. We bought a gentle,  tame cow which I named lolanthe. Willie showed us how to milk  her after extracting a promise that he would not have any further  involvement. He alone knew what having a cow meant. He also warned  and was proved right that it would cost more to feed that one cow than  to buy milk in the store. But cost was not the chief object and even  Willie did not know then how welcome her butter and cheese would  be in the coming period of rationing. There was a plentiful vegetable  garden, all planted according to the latest US Department of Agriculture  pamphlets. Rosalind had sent for these, along with instructions on cheese  making and dairy procedures. We had beehives from which we extracted  honey. Every summer the fresh fruit was dried under screens on the  roof and sent along with other produce through the agency of CARE  to Europe. There was endless canning of tomatoes, beans and fruit.  Fortunately for Iolanthe, Krinsh developed an allergy to her for she  didn't like the feel of his chronically icy fingers and would turn her  head around to glare at him and invariably plop her foot in the milk  pail. So milking was out of the question for him; instead he gathered  the cowpats and tossed them on the compost heap and hosed out the  barn in his high rubber boots. My mother and Krinsh worked the  vegetable garden together. We even tried a hydroponic garden which  an Indian friend of ours, called Sharma, had just developed for the US  Navy. Krinsh was supposedly spending most of his day in retreat but  actually he seemed to prefer, or felt an obligation, to hang about my  mother during the long hours of heavy work. [ milked the cow every  morning before breakfast and then again before dinner. Although I went  to a private school, I took the public school bus and Krinsh never failed  to walk with me to the road where the bus stopped. He waited discreetly  behind the rock wall until he saw me safely oft. When the bus returned  me 1in the afternoon I watched the tip of his straw hat moving along  behind the wall until I met him at the driveway. He never embarrassed 
    181  
 
                   
 
    me by showing himself, nor did he upset my sense of independence by  making me feel his presence was anything but companionable. Krinsh  always took an afternoon walk when there wasn't a badminton game  on. He tried to coerce my exhausted mother into going along and  sometimes we all went with the cow in tow. She liked to graze along  the road in the grassy season and this saved on the cost of alfalfa. Maria  and Aldous turned up one day with a large barrel-shaped butter churn.  Thereafter, making butter became a regular routine. Frieda Lawrence  sent an encouraging letter: 
    Dear Rosalind, 
    I want to send you my greetings because it is a pleasure to think  of you these days and all of you & your goodwill, when the world  is so full of bad will Ал 
    A woman brought me the life of Krishnamurti by Ludowic Rebault  and I was so very interested in Krishna's fight with those dumb  theosophists! Always the same story! It reminded me so much of  Lawrence in another way Ал and the things Krishna says are much  like Lawrence. All big men have really the same ultimate source of  the vision, only each in his own individual way. 
    Maria wrote some time ago that you made butter & it is a success.  I hope you are all well; it is a joy to think ofa child like Rhada [sic]  to have so much love. 
    My kindest greetings and wishes to you all Ал  FRIEDA 
    Being a pacifist in that era was a considerably less popular position to  hold than it is today, especially when the fascist atrocities began to come  to light. When confronted with the question: what alternative to war is  there against such evil forces? the answer might be much the same as that  ofa doctor of preventative medicine being asked to cure a terminal lung  cancer patient. Solutions based on certain medical or moral philosophies  must begin at the source, before the disease has started and progressed to  a critical stage. The doctor would have told his patient to stop smoking  years before and the pacifist would be constantly alert to alleviating the  causes of war. Unfortunately those in power throughout the world are  seldom, if ever, pacifists. 
    Robert Logan and Aldous Huxley, on either side of the Atlantic, had  striven hard and eloquently to offer peaceful solutions to the alarming  rise of fascism in the early 1930s. They had very similar philosophies.  In his pamphlet Case for Constructive Peace, Aldous wrote in 1936: 
    182  
 
                         A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    War is a purely human phenomenon. Animals kill for food . . . fight  duels in the heat of sexual excitement . . . Man is unique in organizing  the murder of his own species. War is not a law of nature. The old  saw about the survival of the fittest is obviously nonsensical Ал active  warfare tends to eliminate the young and strong . . . aerial warfare  kills indiscriminately . . . 
    The whole philosophy of constructive pacifism is based on a  consideration of the facts of personal relationship between man and  man. 
    There are men who profess to be pacifists in international  politics, but who are tyrants in their families, bullying employers,  or unscrupulous competitors . . . [It is not| possible for a government  to behave as a pacifist when the individuals it represents conduct  their affairs in an essentially militaristic way. Constructive peace  must be first of all a personal ethic . . . Means determine ends 
    . the only right and practical policy is one based on truth and  generosity. 
    Aldous went on to lay out a practical plan through a conference of  the great powers to deal with Mussolini's aggression against Abyssinia  and to try to settle some of the injustices of the Versailles Treaty. After  which he continued: 
    The greatest immediate sacrifices . . . will have to come from those  who possess the most. These sacrifices, however will be negligible  in comparison with the sacrifices demanded from us by another war.  Negligible in comparison even with those which are at present being  demanded by the mere preparations for war. 
    And with the full impact of his enormous eloquence, he concluded:  ?(r)One generous gesture on the part ofa great nation may be enough to  set the whole world free. 
    Ojai was to become a haven for pacifists during the war. There were  many faces of pacifism among us but Aldous, Mr Robbie and Krinsh  all believed that peace must be a clear issue within an individual before  he could publicly promote it. Also they recognized that during the fever  of war political pressure was no longer feasible. 
    Rosalind had her own very strong tradition of pacifism and was in  no sense simply following along with Aldous, Mr Robbie, or Krishna  when she wrote to Blanche her feelings about the darkening scene in  Europe. 
    183  
 
                   
 
      Dearest Blanche, 
    . . . I am so afraid of all the movements that are being started  to try and make peace in Europe. They seem to close our eyes  to the things that are happening here and might easily lead us  into war. Considering that we are supposed to be rank idealists  sound very realistic, don't you think? I think if some of the heads  of government were a little more realistic they would try and find  some other solution than war for their problems. People are so taken  up with the outside chaotic problems that they have no time to know  what living means . . . 
    The inevitability of war was coming ever closer, and again Rosalind  wrote to Blanche, her tone even bleaker than the year before. 
    Feb 14, 1941  Politically everything seems more and more confused and I wonder  if we will ever know the truth about anything? The more one tries  to have an open mind the more everything seems to go right through  it and one is left with nothing at all. One can't see very far ahead  can one? 
    And then on 9 December 1941: ?(r)Now the conflagration is complete.  If you come out to the coast you had better come to us here. The  world is mad.' 
    Early in 1942 Raja sold the Star Trust office in Hollywood and moved  all the work to Ojai. Jon D. Davidson, the architect, who was designing  a house in Ojai for the Vigevenos, designed a small apartment for Raja  over an office and fireproof room situated in the orchard next to Krinsh's  Pine Cottage. Raja had no inclination to move into the mАД|nage at Arya  Vihara. He appeared only for dinner at the big house, never for lunch;  sometimes Krinsh took him a breakfast tray. 
    My father had always remained behind the scenes and seemingly  enjoyed that spot. But he had never liked being referred to as Krinsh's  secretary or manager. Neither did he like being asked by countless old  ladies what Krinsh ate, when he meditated and other personal details.  Nevertheless he had always shouldered this nuisance side of his life as  part of his work. 
    It was a bit much when he was blamed for Krinsh's misdemeanours.  Once my mother and 1 were having tea with an elderly lady in Santa  Barbara and Rosalind mentioned that Krishna had been caught speeding 
    184  
 
                         A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    on the way down from Carmel. ?(r)Oh no!' she said, ?(r)It must have been  Rajagopal. It couldn't have been our dear Krishna.?А└ My father had not  even been in the car. Another incident that had particularly galled  Raja occurred a few years before in India. He and Krishna were being  accompanied to the airport by their very wealthy and elderly host,  who, as he said goodbye to Krishna, pressed into his hand a large  wad of money. Krishna dropped it on the ground as if it had been a  snake. He said, ?(r)I don't handle money, give it to Rajagopal,' leaving  it in the dust for someone else to pick up. 
    Yet in spite of their quarrels, Raja's affection for Krishna never seemed  to waver. His isolation and pessimism increased, but everyone in our  circle seemed pessimistic in those war years. (Aldous would sometimes  arrive in such a state of gloom that Maria would beg us to leave off all  war talk for a few days.) Raja enjoyed much of that part of his life that  he could keep separate from Krishna and Rosalind. He was a person  who was most content when working and was fortified in this attitude  by Willie, who fully shared it. 
    Willie Weidemann was probably the person closest to Raja, who had  taught Willie to do all the accounts and book work connected with  running the ranch and Star Publishing. He and Raja shared a similar  sense of humour, which included seeing American ways through the  eyes of the foreign born. They had many laughs over the latest popular  songs like ?(r)T've got spurs that jingle jangle jingle " and American idioms  and dialects. There was a couple called the Hawkins who had come out  from the dust bowl of Oklahoma. They helped with the orchard and the  housework. Both Raja and Willie soon adopted many of their phrases  like, ?(r)Everything's did that oughta be did', and ?(r)Go straight down there  and don't tyrn no whichaways.' 
    We still managed to get up to Sequoia, despite the petrol rationing  during the war. We only went to the village once a week and perhaps  once a month to Santa Barbara. Thus we saved enough coupons for  the one long drive to the Sierra. 
    My father spent just a few days each summer at Sequoia, finding a  ride up and returning with us to Ojai. He was markedly not conforming  to Krinsh's quite rigid daily routines. He always had his own little cabin,  as did Krinsh, while my mother, David and I shared a bigger one where  we did the cooking. I would visit my father in his cabin every morning  and he read me the story of Amos or some other prophet or saga from  the Bible, probably because the Bible was provided by the Lodge and  there was nothing else to read except magazines with terrible war news,  from which I was protected. A few years later when the Modern Library 
    185  
 
                   
 
    brought out a translation of Dostoevski's The Idiot, Krinsh brought it to  the mountains and, in turn, it kept us both busy. I lay on a fallen giant  sequoia near our cabin and read all morning, giving him the book in  the afternoon. ' 
    Each summer we took long walks in the High Sierra, capped by a  final strenuous hike for which we had spent our entire vacation getting  in condition. My father would arrive from QOjai a few days before  this exploit and refuse to get out of bed all day. Krinsh would do  all he could to persuade him to exercise, but without the least effect.  When the morning of the big hike came, my father was up and ready  with the rest of us. Much to our surprise and Krinsh's mixture of  annoyance and amusement, he beat us all to the top of the peak and  back (a twenty-mile round trip) without any evident ill effects, more  than could be said for the lot of us, including Krinsh. Whether he did  this deliberately to annoy or was just functioning on his own track we  never knew. 
    One summer in Sequoia, a few days before we were going to leave,  we found a tanager with a broken wing. My mother crocheted a delicate  sling for her and very soon the little bird was so tame that she would sit  on our fingers and let us hold her up to the windowpane to snap up live  flies. We had to take her back to Ojai with us as her wing was still far  from mended. 
    Our habit was to leave late mid-afternoon to avoid the valley heat  and arrive in Ojail about ten at night. We usually carried a picnic  supper as Krinsh hated eating in restaurants, but this particular time  we had neglected to do so and were forced to stop at a little cafАД| in  Bakersficld. None of us, not even my father, noticed the sign on the  door which stated that the establishment reserved the right to refuse  service to anyone. We certainly looked no worse, in our blue jeans and  sneakers and with Krinsh in his straw hat trying not to be recognized,  than any of the other patrons of that rather grimy diner. We were taken  for migrant farmers or braceros, or whoever else the cafАД| owner decided  he had the right to refuse service to, and were asked, not very politely,  to leave. Even the little bird perched on my finger did not soften him.  Standing somewhat in shock outside the door, we heard a gentle voice  say, ?(r)I witnessed that. It is disgraceful and [ feel ashamed for my town.  insist that you let me take you all to a decent place for dinner.?А└ We could  hardly refuse and followed the man to a fancy restaurant with white  tablecloths which welcomed us, blue jeans, bird, vegetarianism and all.  It turned out, surprisingly enough, that even in Bakersfield Krinsh had  been recognized. 
    186  
 
                         A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    The little tanager became one of our most loved pets, and although  the wing never healed well enough for her to fly, she seemed to enjoy  her life in our care. Our cat Minnie exhibited extreme jealousy towards  the bird. We were careful to keep her locked in the house when we  had the bird outdoors. One afternoon Ignon, our French painter friend,  came for tea. He, among all our friends, had a special love for the bird.  Suddenly, out of nowhere, Minnie sprang, grabbed the bird and dashed  out of reach under the house. I was heartbroken; Ignon was so furious  he swore he would kill the cat if he could lay hands on her. Minnie  knew enough to keep out of sight for over a week. But she lost a great  deal of our affection. 
    Before the Japanese residents in California were interned, Rosalind had  ordered seventy-five newly hatched chicks, the last batch that would  be sexed as eggs by the Japanese, who were said to be the only people  with the ability to tell from the eggs which were to be hens and which  roosters. My mother, Krinsh and I drove to the train station in Ventura  late one night to pick up our precious cargo and brought the little chicks  home to the coop that Krinsh and Willie had built. There was not one  rooster in the batch. We soon found that a rooster was necessary to keep  peace among the hens and scare off the weasels. We added a big iridescent  black cock of the walk called Hercules. Every Saturday, Krinsh, David  and I scraped out the chicken coop. Krinsh seemed to take on the most  menial chores with a hearty enthusiasm. I collected the eggs and fed  the chickens and in the process made pets of all seventy-five hens and  Hercules, who dominated their lives. Several hens had a name from  Greek mythology, which I was studying in school at the time, and I  claimed to know each one by her voice. 
    Soon egg production was going full tilt and we even had a surplus to  preserve in vats of lye for the lean season. Eggs were sorted and cleaned  and sold to neighbours and devotees, who probably thought they had  special qualities, as it was known that Krinsh helped in all this. 
    There was such a demand for our produce that we bought another  young cow called Tina, who had been an orphan and hand-fed by bottle.  She was so well-bred that I could bring her into the living-room and she  never once misbehaved. Neither did Hercules who, with one or two of  his privileged hens, ate their dinner in a common bowl alongside the cat  under the kitchen stove (usually while my mother was trying to cook  dinner). 
    Just before dinner was also the favourite hour for Norbert Schiller, 
    the Austrian actor and poet, to arrive. He had built his own round 
    187  
 
                   
 
    stone house down the road, and would walk up to Arya Vihara and  right into the kitchen with his goat. The goat nibbled on the tablecloth  or Krinsh's straw hat while Schiller produced a very smelly goat cheese  from his leather pocket for our meal. This was indeed most generous of  him for he lived almost solely on goat cheese and the mustard greens  and avocados which he picked from our orchard. Eventually he would  prosper by getting character parts in films. In those days no one in Ojai  prospered, nor did they appear interested in doing so. Money played  but a small part in any of our lives. 
    Although he was sympathetic to our endeavours, my father took no  active part in the farming at which we worked so strenuously during  the war years. He kept himself busy in his office, but Krinsh, prevented  by the war from his customary travels, would probably have been bored  and restless without all his chores. 
    Life on the farm got harder. The two ranch hands were drafted,  leaving only Willie who, as manager, was exempt. The initial excitement  of getting the enterprises going wore offa bit and the endless realities  of labour and the demands of the animals became all we had time or  energy for. Yet with the world in the state it was, we felt exceptionally  fortunate. 
    Rosalind worked from six in the morning till after dinner each night.  In addition to the farm work she still made my few good clothes and  my father's and Krinsh's good shirts and nightshirts. Most of the time  we wore blue jeans and denim shirts, except my father, who stuck to  his old English grey flannels. 
    Eventually we were allowed to provide agricultural labour for two  young conscientious objectors who came to stay at Arya Vihara and  help there as an alternative to war duty. One of them, Bill Quinn, had  gone to Harvard and was deeply influenced by Thoreau. In fact, he was  far better at quoting Thoreau than wielding a pitchfork, but in time his  gentle ways won over even the cows. Life at Arya Vihara suited him  perfectly. He had a fondness for the animals which was a requirement  in caring for them as the two cows, all seventy-five hens and Hercules  were my personal pets. 
    Rosalind did her best to keep up a correspondence with her closest 
    friends. To Blanche, in November 1942, she wrote: ?(r)We are well and 
    busy. A friend who has not seen Krishnaji for months says she has never 
    seen him look so blooming. So now you will be able to put down the 
    New York rumors of death and illness. Raja is one moment seemingly 
    all right and the next not so well.?А└ The false rumours had brought wires 
    of condolence about Krinsh's supposed death.

A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    Mr Robbie, ever faithful with his letters, must have been one of  Rosalind's prime diversions during these years. He had a light touch  in everything, even in expressing his strong feelings about the war: 
    Jan 5, 1943  Dearest Rozzie, 
    Aside from the cold and the rationing and the taxes everything  is better Ал better than next year! Mabel [his secretary] and I have  reserved passage on the American Airlines for L.A. and hope that  the O.P.A. and the W.P.B. and the Japs and the Germans will not  prevent our going . . . 
    Aug 25, 1943  Have you read about the ?(r)Big Inch'? the 24 inch pipeline which has  just been completed from Texas to Pennyslvania and New Jersey. It  has broken twice since it was completed last week and thousands of  acres only a few miles from here have been ruined and the Nesharminy  Creek and the Delaware River have a scum of oil on them which has  killed thousands of fish. Nice going! And now the only man in the  Cabinet Ал Sumner Welles Ал has been fired because old lady Hull and  the Southern voters thought he had too many brains. 
    Sept 23, 1943  Dearest Rozzie, 
    Beato recently wrote quite incidentally something so nice about  you and so cleverly phrased that I must share it. She said: ?(r)I have  not seen Rosalind nor Rajagopal since you left. I long for a glimpse  of Rosie, she has the power to dispel with such quick immediacy the  thickness of everyday life.' 
    That is a gem of a sentence and in your case, dear, it is true. How  are you and Radhi and Raja and Krinsh and the cows and the bees  and the chickens? Don't feel you have to write, but a line 1s always  appreciated. 
    too put my oar in the pacifist cause by volunteering my father to  counter-argue a March of Time newsreel on India that had been shown  in my school. Even at eleven, I was outraged by the broadside attack  on Gandhi and asked the headmaster if he would invite my father to  give a truer picture. This he willingly did and then asked me for a little  background on my father Ал a tall order which I simplified by saying,  ?(r)When he was a little boy he was so poor he stood around garbage 
    189  
 
                      pails to catch the crows to eat.?А└ I have no idea how this image of  my Brahmin, vegetarian father could have entered my imagination or  what mischievous impulse came over me. Just before Raja had to give  his talk the headmaster asked him if he had really lived on crows as a  young boy. My father was so baffled by this question it is a wonder  he could talk at all, but he did and, much to my pride, so brilliantly  explained Gandhi's actions and philosophy that not only the headmaster  but most of my friends changed their attitude toward India Ал in spite  of my crow story. 
    The old days of beautiful pergolas and roses and lily ponds at Arya  Vihara vanished with the war and the need for all our effort to go into  productive activity. As Mr Robbie observed: 
    Jan 6, 1944 
    . . . I am sorry about the pergola which Sara took such pleasure 
    in building. I should have been glad to help repair it but I suppose 
    Willie, Raja and Krinsh felt that it was of little use and should be 
    replaced by something that would bring in a return . . . 
    Please forgive me for dragging you into this S affair. I don't 
    know what she has in mind and doubt if she does either so [ tried 
    out the formula for success in Washington: ?(r)Shoot the bull, pass the 
    buck and make seven copies of everything!' 
    Love, 
    ROBERT 
    Mr Robbie was referring to an unbalanced lady who had been  troubling him over her fixation on Krinsh, wanting Mr Robbie to  intercede on her behalf. 
    As is to be expected around people like Krinsh, there was never a  shortage of unbalanced people; most of them quite harmless but some  creating a good deal of consternation. One could only hope that, as  Aldous put it in one of his later talks, the lunatic fringe did not become  like a Spanish shawl where the fringe is greater than the shawl. In some  instances Krinsh exacerbated the problem by not dealing with them de- cisively in the first place. A few were bordering on the dangerous. One  of these cases was a supposedly crippled and semi-bedridden woman  who lived down the hill from Arya Vihara. She wrote several pitiful  letters to Krinsh and he finally agreed to go and visit her, which he  then continued to do regularly. One day I answered the front-door  bell to find a stout unkempt woman standing there on her crutches. 
    190  
 
                         A Garden of Peace in a World at War 
    I immediately guessed her identity, which was confirmed when our  cat Minnie, who herself had become slightly demented after the bird  incident, took one look at the woman, arched her back and hissed. |  felt my elders should have taken this as a serious warning, but they did  not do so. 
    Another day my friend Ellen and I, walking in the hills, saw this  woman charging down the path with her crutches tucked under her  arm. I told Krinsh I thought he was being deceived. My mother began  to receive anonymous letters threatening terrible consequences if she did  not get out of Krinsh's house. Finally Mr Robbie was accosted by the  woman, who threatened him with her crutch. This was taken seriously.  Thanks to the unorthodox co-operation of the post lady (who gathered  and delivered the mail in her Model A) my father was able to prove  where the letters came from. After much difficulty, legal action was  taken and the threatening member of the ?(r)fringe' banished from the  state of California. 
    One of our harmless members of the ?(r)fringe' seemed fairly normal  by day but on moonlit nights would wander up and down the road  in front of Arya Vihara with her long white hair streaming down  her back, chantuing Krishnaji-i-i-, Krishnaji-i-1. My mother had made  a dressmaker's form which probably accounted for the rumour started  by this woman that Rosalind kept a skeleton in her closet. That papier  michАД| form of my mother must have terrified the poor moonstruck  lady, but perhaps it taught her to keep out of other people's closets. 
    Although I had been strictly brought up by Krinsh not to indulge in  beliefs (which had effectively done away with fairies, leprechauns,  Santa Claus and God), I was astonished one night to discover that  ghosts fell' into another category, although just what category I was  never to discover. I sensed already that ghosts might not fall in the  realm of belief. But no one in our family had ever mentioned them in  the realm of personal experience either. Once I saw a startled look on  Krinsh's face when I matter-of-factly stated that [ had seen Nitya's ghost  in the hallway. There was something in his expression that forbade my  making further play of this, which was all it had been. I knew that  Nitya had died in the front room but he was in some ways alive to  me even though I had never seen him. My mother had spoken of him  often and of her times with him, reading poetry and singing, and I had  picked up some of her nostalgia. He was seldom mentioned by Krinsh  or my father. 
    One evening at dinner my father said that for the past three nights 
    191      someone had been entering his fireproof room, which was double- locked and impossible to break into. The metal door made a peculiar  clang when it shut, no matter how careful one was. Each night he had  investigated and found no sign of a person. ?(r)It must be a ghost,?А└ he  said. My mother looked annoyed by the story and put no credence  in the idea of a ghost, which she was determined to lay to rest. She  did have some anxiety that it might be a person, one of our ?(r)fringe'  perhaps. Krinsh suggested that the three of us, without telling Raja,  take turns keeping watch all night from his veranda, which overlooked  Raja's office. Of course, I thought the whole thing a great lark and felt  sure that was indeed all it was until, when it was my turn to keep the  watch, Krinsh said to me in utmost earnestness, 
    ?(r)Kittums, remember this: a ghost can never hurt you. It can only  make you think it has hurt you.' 
    At first, I was inclined to assume he was only adding a little spice to  our adventure, but when I looked at his face [ knew he wasn't joking.  He was really nervous about leaving me alone out there. Nothing  whatsoever appeared that night and the next day we asked my father  if he had heard his ghost. Most disappointingly he replied that there  had been no sounds all night. So the mystery was never solved, but  the sounds never recurred. 
    The war was nearing its end, and reports came from Europe that were  more and more horrifying. Not until then had Annie Vigeveno known  that over forty of her family had died in the gas chambers. Ommen  had been used by the Nazis as a concentration camp. Some friends had  died and some had survived, but Ommen would never be the same and  Krishna would never return there. 
    Mr Robbie wrote, ?(r)I am sorry too about Mrs Vigeveno. [ am afraid  Germany earned her fate by allowing a crazy fanatic to dictate her  policies and alienate from her the whole common sense (even if largely  hypocritical) world.?А└ And in reference to a smaller private war, he  commented, ?(r)Did you know that George Arundale has repudiated 
    Ал for himself at least Ал= Co-Masonry, the L.C.C. and the E.S.? He  says the only essential teaching of theosophy is brotherhood; too bad  he didn't think of that sooner.'  192
