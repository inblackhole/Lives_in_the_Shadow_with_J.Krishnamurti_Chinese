    Although Krinsh was certainly the magnet that attracted people to our  lives, there were a few, like Sara and Robert, who turned their main  focus on Rosalind. Robert was like a father to her and did much to  replace her own father whom she had left when she was sixteen. Much  as Sara loved and admired Raja and Krishna, my mother remembers  her saying that women should not live in dependency on men and  that she was going to see to it that some day Rosalind would have  financial independence. At the time Rosalind paid no attention to these  comments. Years later she would understand the seriousness of Sara's  intentions. Before she died, Sara asked Robert to honour in his will her  wish that Rosalind would inherit a sizeable portion of their estate. They  both had faith that she would do something worthwhile with her life,  independent of Krishna or Raja. 
    Sara built an apartment for Rosalind on the second floor of Arya  Vihara. She thought Raja's rheumatism would improve if he slept on  an upper level, but her main purpose was to provide them with more  privacy than the downstairs of Arya Vihara afforded. Sara did not realize  that Raja and Rosalind were living separate marital lives and she certainly  did not realize that the apartment with its front and rear outside staircases  would grant Krishna even greater opportunity to visit Rosalind in Raja's  absences from Ojai. Nor did I ever mention to anyone those frequent  early mornings when from my bedroom window I saw Krinsh, in the  white raw silk nightshirts that my mother made for him, creeping up  the stairs with a flower in his hand. Those were their times together,  early mornings and sometimes late evenings, after | was supposed to  be safely tucked away in bed. 
    In the summer of 1937 my mother and [ went east, first to the Logan's  summer place in Winter Harbor and then to Sarobia to meet my father  and Krinsh, who were arriving from Europe. 
    The Winter Harbor house was a large, typical New England summer  house. There was a sloping green lawn to the bluff above the rocky  beach. We had blueberries every morning for breakfast, freshly picked 
    147      from the surrounding woods. My mother and Sara spent hours putting  together puzzles or playing chess while I roamed about the gardens,  often following Mr Robbie doing those chores he so assiduously set  for himself. 
    The Logans believed in self-sufficiency and they ran a household with  minimal servants. Guests washed their own dishes and helped with the  cooking; even if they were European princesses, of whom there was  one in the house that summer. I cannot remember why she was there  for no one seemed to know her very well, but the Logans were already  beginning their era of hospitality to the displaced fugitives of fascism.  This particular Princess was pretty but in my six year old's opinion,  spoiled. She had no idea how to wait on herself. She and my mother  played tennis together while I sat on the sidelines and struck up a  friendship with an elderly gentleman who later insisted my mother  bring me to tea in his Park Avenue apartment. 
    Sara and Robert were abruptly called away to California by a crisis  in their daughter Deborah's life. The Princess took advantage of our  hosts' absence to insist that my mother and I move out of the room  Sara had assigned us. She claimed it was more suitable for her. My  mother complied without hesitation for her nature was such that she  never felt comfortable with anything that anyone else coveted, but Sara  was indignant when she later found out. 
    The Logans' tragedy centred around Deborah, their only child. Eight- een years before, when she was not quite twenty years old, Deborah had  fallen under the influence of a doctor of sorts, a hypnotist who had in- duced Deborah to marry him and adopt his daughter, presumably in the  hope of acquiring the Logan fortune. This man had had two previous  wives, and Deborah claimed the last wife had died an unnatural death.  She told Sara that she had even been forced to help dispose of the  dismembered body, but the whole story was so improbable and grisly,  so alien to everything in their lives, lives which tolerated no form of  killing Ал even a fly Ал that Sara could not decide whether Deborah was  hallucinating or had been hypnotized by her husband in order to bring  her under his control. If the story were true she knew that to open  an inquiry would create a horrible scandal and do worse damage to  Deborah. She was afraid to tell Robert, fearing that his pacifism might  be overridden by his anger against a man who had so used his daughter.  The worst of all for Sara to bear was that it was her own interest in this  doctor's unorthodox medicine that had led to his meeting Deborah and  inducing her away from her parents to California. It is an indication of  her love and confidence in Rosalind that she told her alone the details of 
    148  
 
                   
Sages and Shadows 
    this story. Rosalind bore the burden of that terrible secret in silence for  over forty years. Sara and Robert succeeded finally in rescuing Deborah  from the clutches of this man, only to find her so badly damaged that  they despaired of her ever recovering from the mental breakdown which  she suffered that summer. 
    In the midst of her tribulations Sara took the time to write to Rosalind  just after she arrived in California. 
    Fri. P. M., July 30th, 1937 
    Dear Rosie,  I do hope you are having breakfast in bed and resting, a real rest 
    Ал and some tennis . . . I saw Deborah twice! It is very terrible! 1  cannot be sure she knew me. Got Dr White [Deborah's husband]  to sign for her at a private hospital. She is to see no one and they  do not want her to even have me go in to see her but of course I  simply had to . . . They say it is a kind of mental case that never  gets well or kills Ал she is strong physically. IfI could only be with  her I feel it might help at some ofthand moment, but, as Rob says  the Doctor is very fine, is tremendously interested in the case and  White's queer ways and that she for the 1st time 1n all these years  is out of his house and influence. That is some hope that she might  at least be free of his pull . . . The Doctor says this phase lasts from  three weeks to four months and the following stage of reaction and  depression indefinite time in years Ал but I never give up and yet look  for nothing to take refuge in. Without last year at Ommen I assure  you I could not have witnessed this corner of the vortex with such  quiet and calm . . .  Of course, I understood very little of this at the time but put together  bits and pieces of adult conversation later. A great part of my diversion  as a child was listening in on adult conversations. We seemed to be  surrounded by people who had intense and often interesting problems  and I very early found out that ifI remained as ?(r)quiet as a mouse' as [  was often told to and never interrupted, my presence was overlooked.  I often overheard much more than anyone intended I should. 
    At the end of that summer, Krinsh and both my parents and [ prepared  to drive across country in our new Lincoln Zephyr, which they had  bought at factory price for only nine hundred dollars. It was silver- green with two doors, one wide front seat for the three adults and a  small rear seat for me. 
    149  
 
                   
 
    Sara gave us a picnic basket with red and white plastic dishes and 
    cutlery to match, all of such good quality that I still have them. Motels  were just beginning to sprout up around the country, not the luxurious  type of today but sparsely furnished individual bungalows. We always  picnicked on the road for lunch. It being still in the Depression, we  were often joined by a hobo, to whom my mother would offer at least  a hard-boiled egg, cooked on a camping stove in the motel, before 
    setting off each morning. 
    I cannot imagine how we all survived that trip, cooped up for weeks 
    in a one and a half seat car. I do not remember it as a happy time but 
    neither do I remember any particular ?(r)scenes'. It was an unusual thing 
    for all of them to be doing. They never took long journeys for the fun 
    of it and perhaps this came close enough to a pleasure trip for them 
    to do their best to behave toward each other as well as they could. 
    It was the first time I was acutely conscious that when others weren't 
    around all three of them at once were too many. Everything was more 
    pleasant when they came in twos. 
    Krinsh wrote a thorough report to Mr Robbie about the trip shortly 
    after we arrived back in Ojai, giving all the technical details about the 
    car, its fuel consumption, powers of acceleration in the mountains, 
    and the fact that he gave it a daily bath all across the country. He 
    was quite ecstatic about that car. When it was his turn to drive he 
    took off at alarming speed. Once, that is, that the engine had been 
    perfectly broken in according to a timetable he had established. 
    Krinsh prided himself on having been taught to drive by Miss 
    Dodge and Lady De La Warr's chauffeur in their new Rolls-Royce. 
    In those days, the Rolls-Royce Company provided a specially trained 
    chauffeur with the automobile. Krinsh learned a system of driving that 
    was supposed to save the brakes by always rolling to a slow stop, never 
    riding the clutch, varying the engine speed every ten minutes and above 
    all *?(r)watching out for the other fool'. This sounds sensible when combined 
    with moderate speeds which were essential on English country roads, 
    but it also presupposes a limit on speed with which Krinsh did not 
    bother. There are some people who are thankful to be alive in spite 
    of having ridden with him at the wheel. My mother, on the other 
    hand, prided herself on having driven a car from the age of twelve 
    and a motor-boat before that. Her grandfather was the first man in 
    Buffalo to own an automobile. It was she who taught my father to 
    drive, though it was his bad luck on one of his first lessons in Britain 
    to rear-end a Scotsman and knock off his fuel tank. Both Krinsh and my 
    mother frequently expressed slightly scornful criticism of Raja's driving. 
    150  
 
                         Sages and Shadows 
    Even my father, however, had fewer accidents and near accidents than  did Krinsh. There was also the problem of car sickness from which my  mother and I suffered. Cutting corners and keeping a steady foot on the  accelerator was essential, which Krinsh did well enough but my father  tended toward jerkiness, abrupt stops and swishing corners. All this  did not lead to a completely harmonious three-thousand-mile drive. 
    The sight I found most impressive was the Carlsbad Caverns. Having  been read Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn by Mr Robbie that summer,  caves held for me a graphic interest. Krinsh, on the other hand, was not  the least impressed by the caverns and he wrote to Mr Robbie saying  he greatly preferred Boulder Dam. Perhaps, as he himself suggested,  my adults were just tired the day we saw Carlsbad, for that was  uncharacteristic of Krinsh, who was always extolling the works of  nature over those of man. Perhaps he was impressed by the fact that  an astute guard at the dam sensed among us an important personage.  However unlikely it might be that he knew exactly who Krinsh was,  he gave us an exclusive private tour. For some reason long forgotten  we skipped the Grand Canyon altogether. Of course they had all seen  it before I was born. 
    Mr Robbie took the trouble to write to me en route. From then on  he wrote me weekly letters whenever we were separated.

    Dear Srog, [Mr Robbie's nickname for me after my mispronunciation 
    of frog] 
    I wonder how the Zeppelin is flying along and whether you have 
    heard any srogs along the wayside saying ?(r)Brek-ek-ek-ek Co-ax 
    Co-ax'. 
    We have been missing you all very much even Pack Wack [his big 
    fat cat] has been asking where his scroggy friend has disappeared, and 
    the wind says it 1s hardly worth blowing over Sarobia when there are 
    no badminton birds to blow about. 
    [ enclose cards for Krinch and Daddy. 
    Much love from, 
    MR ROBBIE 
    We had been invited to visit Frieda Lawrence in Taos, New Mexico.  Frieda had been at Arya Vihara the year before and wrote to Rosalind  Jjust before we started out from Sarobia. 
    151  
 
                      Kiowa Ranch, San Cristobal, N.M. 12 Oct, 37  Dear Rosalind, 
    We are looking forward to your coming, come as soon as you can  because of the weather. You know we are so high and you might  find snow. Tell me if you would all like to meet people or rather  have a rest Ал It has been so very lovely, the mountains superb, with 
    aspens turning yellow and the red oak and dark pines.  So we will look for you about the 26th. I won't forget you are  vegetarians.  With kindest regards,  FRIEDA L  (and from me Angelino) 
    Anyone who knows Frieda's story will of course recognize Angelino  as her lover at that time and later as her husband; D. H. Lawrence had  died seven years before. 
    I was delighted to be in a private house once more after the weeks  in cramped motel rooms, cating food cooked on a camping stove. We  were given a guest cottage and could make our own breakfasts but ate  the other meals with Frieda. She was plump and red-headed and very  warm toward us all and I felt comfortable among the assorted animals,  including a small pig, who came and went freely through the house. I  soon gravitated toward the barn, where I found Angelino milking the  cow. He was a large man who laughed easily, too easily. I disliked him  at once, an unusual reaction in me. I could not understand his remarks  as he leaned his head on the cow's stomach and yanked at her teats,  nor can I remember them now but I felt uncomfortable and retreated  in silence back to my family. 
    In a letter to a friend in Europe, Maria Huxley beautifully described  Frieda's household and Taos. The Huxleys, whom we had not yet met,  but would shortly after our return to California, had just left there a  month before we arrived. 
    This place, I mean Taos, 20 miles off and where we never go, is a  nest of scandal and quarrels. Frieda has been, and still is so affectionate  and generous and warm-hearted that I do not want anything to come  back to her which could be misinterpreted . . . the quarrels with  her and Mabel Luhan who wanted to steal Lawrence's ashes from a  childish little chapel Frieda built over them here . . . The desert . . .  begins four miles from us . . . pink on the barren soil, grey with the  sage-brush, bright green in the irrigated oasis and the black cracks  which are the turning banks of the Rio Grande . . . 
    152  
 
                         Sages and Shadows 
    Frieda's life is extraordinary. She lives in such a primitive way that  we can hardly understand it. Angiolino built her a concrete house . . .  and the sitting-room is hung by all Lawrence's pictures. But the heart  of the house is a large kitchen which has only a wooden range which  heats, or rather tepids, a little bath water and which must be lit for  every cup of tea. The easiness might be called messiness, the milk  which comes . . . from a pretty Jersey cow is around in all forms  of creams, and butters, and sour creams, and milks and what not 
    . . there are also the pig-bowl and the cat-bowl and the dog-bowl;  many things to horrify me and shock me; yet she is essentially clean  if you can imagine that; perhaps because she is a blonde. My greatest  horror is to be asked to meals; it 1s then taken for granted that I do the  washing up Ал I arrive with my rubber gloves Ал but the mess is such  that if there were a heaven [ deserve a bit of it for every washing up  [ do. Meanwhile there she sits, talking of Montaigne or Buddha or  Mabel Dodge [Luhan] . . . 
    Frieda is continually visited out of the blue by vague friends or  strangers; they want to see Mrs. D. H. Lawrence, and though she  complains she lets them. Then they bring her cakes and think they  have paid her for her trouble.! 
    (The chapel was still there when in 1972 my husband and I and our  children visited the ranch, now run by the University of New Mexico  as a writers' retreat. Lawrence's ashes are in a simple urn inside. Outside,  under a marble slab inscribed with her coat of arms and full German title  of Baroness von Richthofen, lies Frieda.) 
    The affront to Maria's fastidiousness by Frieda's housekeeping would  have been fully shared by the two Brahmin men in her wake if they had  been exposed to it. But Rosalind was adept at establishing, even at the  expense of tact, the standard of cleanliness they would expect. 
    That autumn, soon after our return to California, we met Aldous  and Maria Huxley, who were renting a small apartment near my  grandmother's Gower street house. 
    Maria, like Sara, immediately saw Rosalind for herself, apart from  her connection with Krishna and Raja, and loved her for herself. She  also fully understood the complications of life with a ?(r)great man'. She  admired Rosalind's skills and practicality and there was soon much  sharing and pooling of their respective abilities. 
    In spite of her closeness to Sara Rosalind didn't confide in her that most  essential part of her life Ал her relationship with Krishna. It is hard, 
    153  
 
                   
 
   
    looking back, to believe that this profound and yet worldly woman  would not have recognized exactly what was going on. Perhaps she  did but was far too sensitive to intrude in an area of Rosalind's life  where she had not been invited. 
    Sara never failed to take time to write to Rosalind and to stay in  close touch with her. Sometimes she wrote every day. She wrote the  following letter on 11 January 1938 a couple of months after our drive  across America. She had evidently witnessed some incidents while they  were still at Sarobia. 
    I have thought much of your problems as they are or as I imagine  them to be, personally I feel we cannot do more than accept people,  as they are; and let them be themselves Ал and no matter how close,  let them find with others what we cannot give them. Every man  needs spoiling by some one, he must think well of himself at any  price. The more he doubts his ability to stand alone, the more he will  protest it. A man, like a woman, does not so much want a fuss made  over them, as much as to feel their wives or husbands do not belittle  them, hurt pride is often at the secret of many otherwise congenial  friendships. Marriage or love as it is known is supposed to give no  cause for such a state, so people look out for this, independence from  it as a sign of weakness in the one and insult to the other Ал marriage  be damned as it is expected to be!! It takes a great indifference in  both male and female, as to what other people think to get the  happy companionship that joint interests affords. It's seldom what  the husband thinks of the wife or the wife of the husband that causes  the trouble, but the wonder of the man if he is made to seem small in  the eyes of the world or the wonder of the woman if she is supposed  not able to hold the affections of her husband! Pride or fear of pity or  of censure wrecks many a pleasant enough hand in hand fight through  life. Why a husband and wife feel privileged to tell each other what  they think of each other I do not know: yet it is not a thing that can  be hidden, it is made quite real by words about it yet nothing is as  hopeless as being put into a pigeon hole, and watched as soon as one  tries to sneak out unobserved. I hope Raja has a car of his own, and  can get someone to ride with him who thinks his driving, as well as  everything else he does, is perfect Ал This will help a lot. No doubt  it's stupid to get married just as stupid to get unmarried . . . 
    Whatever else it may have been that set off this treatise on marriage  from Sara, it is certain that during the few weeks we were all at Sarobia 
    154  
 
                         Sages and Shadows 
    after buying the Zephyr she would have witnessed the criticism of  his driving that Raja suffered from both Rosalind and Krishna. She  obviously recognized that Rosalind and Raja's marriage had difficulties;  both Sara and Robert had had love affairs in the course of their marriage  without destroying that part of their relationship they both most valued 
    Ал companionship and love based on a deep mutual respect. She would  have understood a love affair in another's marriage if it was based on  honest understanding between the two married partners. She would  not have understood hypocrisy.  Sara's troubles with Deborah continued. She had brought her daugh- ter home to Sarobia after eighteen years of estrangement. Although  Deborah's health improved remarkably under her mother's care, irrepa- rable damage had been done to her. In her frequent letters to Rosalind,  Sara expressed her depressed as well as her happier moments. 
    Dear Rosie . . . 
    . no doubt happier days have been and may be for me and others,  there is no sense of comparison present, it simply seems enough that  the damp heat of yesterday, broken by a thunderstorm in the evening  has dramatically and marvelously made way for the blissful happy  air of today. New-cut grass, June roses, fragrant honeysuckle fill  the air. 
    This AM Rob neat and dapper with the kerchief border protruding  just the proper degree from the breast pocket, took himself to lunch  and golf at the country club and I was conscious ofa greater serenity  and happiness than I felt he had before this last trip west. It has left  him happier, freer, something lifted. Perhaps to me it has also done  something but not of the nature my friends and family evidently  would feel themselves or expect me to feel Ал when they say ?(r)How  happy you must be to have your daughter with you' but I have  no sense of accomplishment . . . The burden and anxiety of her  immediate danger are, in a way over, but my heart perhaps always  holds too much of the useless refrain. It's ?(r)heavy with the world's 
    . woe', as the Buddha said in some special moment of more  depressmn than happy compassion: if compassion can be happy! Out  of the frying pan into the fire! What frying pan and what fire! who  can say Ал but surely some frying pan and some fire. It needs must be  so, until we are enlightened and out of bondage to illusion and love  of power. How much of a . . . revelation this lasting assurance of  the blissful state may be; how much a weary plodding through life  and death, how much a clearing of the atmosphere created by the 
    155  
 
                             two great beasts of mind and body that the inner man may make a  clear free get away, I do not know. Surely the rose seems to have no  battle with illusion to attain its fullness. As we are nature's products  only to this point and here the real self-conscious hassle begins; to  what indeed can we look for help . . . the warmth of the sun is a  factor in the opening of the rose, perhaps Krishnaji could if I did not  create my own shade aid me . . . In short how, ere it is too late for  this body are we to handle our rudders so the ship rides free with the  wind? A mere man may teach me to steer a boat, no one may teach me  to handle the vessel of myself. Deborah has a headache and is, I hope,  asleep. At times I am overcome by her clear thinking and dynamic  energy. I am so glad you feel drawn to her. She is most balanced and  happy by nature. It seems we are to constantly be reminded that action  comes from some sort of illusion; things, even tragedies, heartbreaks,  narrow escape from being murdered or worse still from murdering,  looked at in the light of an old familiar lamp or under a tree of our  youthful days with one we love, all suddenly is as if it had not been 
    . and we wonder that such days of strife were of such import at  the time. Yesterday as Deborah put on a hat she had got 18 years  ago, she recalled the feel of its soft velvet that she had felt the day  she wore it first. ?(r)Mother how is it, he might have killed me! There  was a moment [ would have gladly killed him, yet the touch of this  velvet and all is suddenly as if it had not been and life is back where  it was 18 years ago.' 
    Right or wrong I assured; life is indeed dangerous, perhaps our  consciousness needs must know the dangers that our own latent  fears and impulses create. They lie near the surface and so we learn  wisdom and compassion, caution and the equality of our likeness to  those about us . . . It is all intensely, momentarily interesting if we  can be keen to our reactions. 
    In this last year of her life Sara's letters indicate that she suffered often  from depressing thoughts. World events in that year were giving cause  for depression as many of those Americans travelling abroad were to  find. Sara wrote her feelings to Rosalind on 19 June 1938 about a friend's  report from Europe just before she herself was to leave for the Ommen  camp with Deborah: 
    when people get to the sailing port . . . one doctor to every 8000  people . . . no money to just sit by till their turn Ал the hope of  leaving. The fear of not getting away and hunger besides. A few 
    156  
 
                         Sages and Shadows 
    men so cruel to so many, and the whole world helpless to help. It's  too much to contemplate. It makes one really ill and heartsick. Yet  history repeats itself and will ever do so . . . What is to become  of the world and its poor stupid and horror loving people as well.  There can be no end to it all. 
    On 3 August 1938, Sara began a sixty-page diary letter for Rosalind,  who would not be at the Ommen Camp that year; this would be the last  camp ever held there. Sara's diary is quoted in part here as it gives a vivid  account of the effect of Krishna's talks on one perceptive individual,  struggling with intense personal problems, while adjusting to and trying  to help a daughter who had been lost to her for cighteen years. Sara was  neither a devotee nor a sentimentalist. She found much personal help in  Krishna's words and recognized that what Krishna gave to his audience  often went beyond words. He transmitted a highly charged energy that  could awaken within the individual a capacity to confront the depths of  his being. Not everyone responded to this force. Some feltit, then turned  it back into an adulation of Krishna rather than applying it to themselves.  Some complained that he offered neither method nor guidance, leaving 
    them to struggle alone. ?АсThose', he would say, ?(r)completely missed the  point.?А└ Krishna seems to have struck a chord that was already well-tuned  in Sara. She listened to him in her own independent way.

    K. opened his talk without preliminaries saying words were futile  Ал and through them it was difficult to understand another. He or  we could not meet in a friendly basis if we looked upon him as a  teacher and he could not meet or understand those here with isms  or propaganda to expound . . . It would be a waste of his time to  discuss these things Ал please leave all our propaganda and problems  behind. Few are living wholly in their great and burning desire to  live or act after their own manner and fullness. We must find out  what we really are and live it in action. To find this out we must  catch ourselves in the act with intelligent choiceless awareness . . .  He spoke of the necessity of great love of morality Ал  ... I feel tired, and as if since 1934 there was nothing to be done  about anything. From then on though anxious about Deborah, felt  it was Rob's job to carry on, since for me it seems fiished which  is absurd. Nothing is ever finished . . . but as if this life and birth  were done; and held for me in this body no more interest and no  desire for rebirth. Perhaps ifI felt I could get over with this wheel 
    157  
 
                             here and now I might find renewed effort possible Ал but my only  hope of any degree of enlightenment must now come not through  action, but through giving up Ал utterly and completely Ал but this  seems as 1if it must come from some sort of frustration of which I  am not aware or hardly conscious Ал which at my age and after 10  years of studying Krishnaji's books as well as himself and my own  reactions a rather futile 10 years of introspection, certainly for me,  the more the mind and intellect and desire for knowledge enter into  it all the more stranded I become and farther from that deeper inner  happiness of unobstructed flow of life. Deborah and I were recalling  together K's talk. It seemed to mean more to her than to me. She is  more attentive to words, more literal Ал she says perhaps I am looking  at too many angles and depths and degrees of meaning as he talks and  so miss much of what he is saying which was interesting in the light  of Amma [Mrs. Besant| saying she questions instead of listening, and  then questioning. 
    To Deborah K's reference to lying fallow was an inspiration, that it  was good and necessary. To me plowing, sowing, reaping and lying  fallow were all a weary process with nothing of the spirit. She thought  [ argued myself into pessimism which she felt was really foreign to me  ... I do not know. Glad at least to see she lives fully in the minute. 
    Frid. Aug 5  Met Rajagopal. He 1s anxious for fear Deborah will get involved in  some unfortunate acquaintance and situation. He is very wise Ал she  certainly seems anxious to make contacts why I do not know and  surprisingly interested in people's names and getting them placed in  some way in connection with us. Several things often make me feel  she is still W's [Dr White, Deborah's ex-husband] agent in some way 
    Ал but this is her, not my affair. Raja said he was trying to save me any  more unhappy situations through her and I should keep an eye on her  but I really cannot though am only too glad to be with her . . . Raja is  so often right I am glad of his warning of not too much freedom for her  here where he feels there are many undesirable ?(r)pick-up' possibilities  for her. It would be only too natural if she should in her happiness at  being free from White want to go on some bat or have some burst  of self-assurance and self expression with those about her.  Aug 6th  Last night I thought much about my selfishness, in being so much  alone Ал the petty annoyances of the constant ?(r)excuse me's' ?(r)thank  you's'; tried to discover why the habit of being alone should result 
    158

    in a sort of frustration . . . Finally after a refreshing nap to find myself  much happier, freer and willing to have no time to myself at all. This  is something. Now I must understand why it is that having someone  stand over one, gesticulating, dynamic, repeating again and again the  same thought, explanation, narrative about things or people one is not  interested in, makes me embarrassed and nervous. I shall call on my  affection and realize | should be or am interested in what interests  her. Its all great fun and I am really so happy to have her here with  me, and she so dear, and grateful for all that life brings her. It is  good for me to learn from her and how another's mind works. I  find mine stops! I am impatient of ways to ends when perhaps only  the ways really matter. 
    This A. M. Krishnaji spoke so wonderfully, so clearly and it  seemed to me for the first time hopefully of our ultimate fulfillment  of happiness and reality. He spoke of nationalism and internationalism  and asked us to think upon it deeply Ал our unfriendliness in camp over  national, political, financial or social barriers. 
    ?(r)We may all, you and I, all be bombarded and killed. So the  burning question is political and national. What are we going to  do about it? Nationalism results from a habit, a prejudice, from  egotism, or belief, in God being on our side. This has been led up  to by the habit in meditation. Those who meditate rely on a habit to  get them somewhere Ал a habit is stagnation, will never lead to truth.  If you meditate find out why you meditate. Those who do not had  also better find out why they don't. I do not say I am for or against  meditation . . . 
    [ would suggest that for the next twenty-four hours those who  were in the habit of meditating give it up for just that time. To think  these problems over, not to gossip to visit but to alone think, deeply 
    Ал after the conflict, the struggle, in the following calm might come  the miracle fulfillment, not to look for it or expect it, but it lay if at  all in the silence after the struggle.'  Yesterday then, he meant as Deborah thought Ал It might come  only in the lying fallow after the tilling. I went too far in the idea,  feeling discouraged that after the lying fallow there was again only  the poor farmer preparing for his next job. 
    So I am left as one who does not meditate. Deborah thought it  might imply it would be good for those who did not, to try Ал I  am not sure of this . . . [ had meditated and repeated mantrams and  taken part in vocal incantations, and the result was a power, as of  another using me Ал my voice was resonant, full of assurance, the 
    159      power was strong though not ungentle like a prayer answered and it  made me feel perhaps that I was to use it for something and I wished  to do nothing with it, not to be a leader, a power in the E.S. service  through which it came . . . I did not believe in rituals, people got  foolish Ал sanctimonious about them . . . I had asked for power and  it had come. It was wonderful but it alarmed me so I had given up  meditation but not quiet thought; concentration; which I think more  safe, intelligent and not, a retreat, or what K. might call an escape. 
    What was extraordinary about Sara is that, having felt this ?(r)power',  she preferred to relinquish 1it, unlike so many who would use such an  experience to promote their own spiritual importance. 
    Aug 10  Deborah seems to be making friends with many people, she seems  quieter, less jerky and dynamic, if not happier Ал more thoughtful. 
    Today K said one must be ?(r)as spontaneous in fear, as in love'.  In an earthquake or a calamity when there is no escape something  surely happens Ал only the real is left to us. 
    I feel that what K is talking about is much simpler than all this  discussion, but suppose I am not simple enough . . . | sometimes  feel this awareness is like sorting buttons or carding wool. It takes  constant diligence . . . K thinks to keep notes . . . or to write to  friends is to keep one's self in one's own ideas and nitches Ал certainly  it often is to seem wiser than we are or to want to share, or show off  but about the notes I write am not yet sure if they hurt or help so  will have to think that out Ал am sure I shall never re-read them so  perhaps its a waste of time to write. By putting reactions down he  may feel we crystalize them and refer to them when we once having  eliminated something need surely not go back to it. I notice when he  writes a letter or poem he does not make many comparisons Ал just  the bird singing. 
    Aug 12  I feel deeply happy like the silent currents at the bottom of the sea  and if my mind and attention is drawn to the surface I do not leave  my depths but bring it to the surface as things happen. I cannot 
    solve problems but when alone am happy with the flow or stillness  about me in which one loses ones self without desire to do so. It is  indeed spontaneous and soon as I find my mind trying to analyze it  it goes . . .

    I can see that all this writing i1s indeed quite useless, a waste of  time, for to put on paper what one gets out of camp is not a help  or the real thing. 
    I met K at the mechanic shop where he had his tire pumped up.  He looked a bit worried or anxious or tired, asked him if he was tired  he said no and it occurred to me there might be many people he had  tried to help and certainly did not Ал some a little but none enough  and among them Rosie [Rosalind] I thought and I have been anxious  for her health for a long time. In 1936 would not say what the trouble  was which made me feel it was really serious with her and I felt at  QOjai K. tried to keep her quiet, unexcited, not overtired, early to  bed, so did not go to play chess in P.M. as she wanted to do for  fear it would keep her up and create a sense of competition which I  do not care about if it ever comes to that. Lay awake a long time last  night wondering if D. [Deborah] and I could join Rosie at Ojai and  Radha Ал keep house, D. could cook until Raja came in late October  to be with her. He tells me she wants an operation for something 
    Ал some pain. But I do not think it the appendix as he intimated. It  comes too quick and severe to be put off till he arrives as he said he  wrote her to do . . .  When she was in Ojai in the spring of 1936, Sara had evidently noticed  Rosalind's condition. She did not know the cause, but Krishna, who did  know, might well have been wondering here at Ommen, two years later,  if Rosalind was again pregnant or had suffered another miscarriage. ?(r)K.  paid us a visit. Felt there was something he wanted to talk about -felt 
    anxious about Rosie but asked him nothing about her . . .'  At the end of Camp Sara expressed her wish to come to Rosalind if  she were having an operation. 
    August 22nd, 1938  Dear Rosie,  . . . Rajagopal told me you were contemplating an operation for 
    the appendix or something and he had written you if possible to  wait for his arrival in L.A. . . . will you really truly let me know  dear Rosie if there is any way or place that Deborah and I could  help you or be with you to give you a real rest and look after you  a bit, so you can get built up before the operation. We know you  enjoy being with us both. This is not the question. The question  1s if we can be of use before or after Raja arrives. Our idea was we  might help with Radha or your mother. Do not want to bother or 
    161  
 
                             complicate anything . . . let me know if I can help personally or a  bit financially . . .  Always lovingly,  SARA 
    Whatever had been the matter with Rosalind was set straight by the  time Raja returned and no more was said about an operation. Sara did  not come to California that autumn. On 13 October 1938 from Sarobia,  she wrote her last letter to Rosalind. 
    this afternoon I picked a few leaves, glowing in mild golden stillness  of an embracing sun and sent them to you. By the time they reach  you they will be dry and wrinkled. They are only a forerunner of the  promise of the fall. The camp meant much to me. It was a stirring  one. At one time in Ojai I was impatient of it all and tried to forget  it. I think now my state of health was at bottom of that spell. You  were dear and asked me to come while you and K. read, and to share  his thoughts with me, and I would have none of it. Impatience got in  my way of enjoyment and gentle questioning Ал what queer creatures  we are and how hard to know ourselves. One learns to value these  unhappy feelings and long after an impulsive something has cropped  up and it is recalled suddenly out of a clear sky and one says, now  [ know, this shows me what was back of that day. 
    I am glad you are feeling better. It will not be long as time goes  till we are all together again.  Goodnight,  SARA 
    Sara died six weeks later. Rosalind felt she had not fully appreciated  her friendship with Sara until after her death. She had not expected this  loss to be such a blow to her. They had shared so many attitudes and  so many interests; building, puzzles, chess, painting. It was only when  Sara was gone that Rosalind realized what a tremendous support this  deeply affectionate friendship had been. 
    From then on Robert took up a correspondence with Rosalind which  was very regular on his part, though not so on Rosalind's, who always  considered herself a poor letter writer. 
    Dec 8, 1938  Darling Rosalind,  Your very dear and understanding letter touched me very deeply.  know how dearly you loved Sara.

    I too felt as you did about her pulling through because she had  pulled through several times before but her heart was weak and  gave out. 
    I am quite sure that although she fought gamely to the end her  ego had really decided to go on, feeling that when she got Deborah  back she had paid off a karmic debt and was free to escape into a  larger and truer world and be free of the irksome limitation of her  troublesome body. 
    Deborah was perfectly splendid through the ordeal and the funeral  but I am very sorry to tell you the bad news that the strain was too  great and she has broken down and is in a nearby hospital after trying  to kill herself. 
    Faithfully,  ROBERT 
    I too felt Sara's loss deeply. After she was gone Mr Robbie no longer  seemed the formidable person to me that he once had been. He was the  only person I knew who liked the Sunday comics and when he was in  Ojai, I would head up to Saro Vihara right after breakfast on Sunday  mornings and spend an hour or two absorbed in two sets of comics.  They weren't available at Arya Vihara because, out of frugality, we  didn't get a paper at all. Anyway the comics were frowned on for  me, but Mr Robbie never gave me away. I think, intellectual though  he was, he believed they represented an important sector of American  culture as did the radio programmes ?(r)Hopalong Cassidy', the ?(r)Lone  Ranger' and ?(r)Charlie McCarthy'. 
    If he was stern with me for mistreating an animal he could be just as  stern with my mother for mispronouncing a word, or eating peanuts  in the cat or singing a song like ?(r)Mama's little baby likes shortnin'  shortnin'', which he could then never get out of his head. 
    But he could write letters straight to a child's heart, mostly about  his or our animals. Once Sara was gone he retreated more and more  into this world of animals and he welcomed those who could share it  with him. He remained actively involved with the Anti-Vivisection  Society, various human rights and animal welfare groups, and the many  individuals whom he never turned away in their need. 
    The autumn, shortly before Sara's death, Blanche Matthias had invited  us to a dinner she was giving in the Town House Hotel in Los Angeles  for the famous Indian dancer Udai Shankar. The dinner followed his  performance and the dessert, a sculptured palace in different flavours 
    163  
 
                   
 
   
    of exotic ice-cream, regrettably made much more of an impression on  me than the dancer; even though the ice-cream never thawed enough  for us to eat it. 
    A few weeks after this memorable evening, Rosalind wrote: 
    Dec 12, 1938 
    Dear Blanche, 
    It was so nice to have your letter and thank you also for the enclosed 
    letter from Shankar. 
    It was a great shock to hear from Mr Logan that Mrs Logan has 
    passed away. You know how fond we were of each other and her 
    passing leaves me with a great sense of loss. I did not know I felt so 
    deeply for her and I was unprepared for anything like this to happen 
    to her . .. 
    When next I see you I want very much to discuss with you about 
    taking Radha to Shankar's new school. Raja is never very keen about 
    my taking Radha and living in India as he says the climate is so bad 
    but I want to very much. 
    This letter is characteristic of my mother who could turn in a sentence  from her grief and shock back toward her zest for life. Yet she felt  sorrow intensely. I have seen it often in her face, her blue eyes with  their innocence fill with silent tears as she bit her lip and gazed away out  the window. Then it would pass Ал brightness would return. My father  attributed this changeableness to her being a Gemini Ал an explanation  that she disliked. 
    Raja had long ago lost any desire to live in India; he returned only  because he had to accompany Krishna and to see his mother. At that  moment he was also pessimistic about the future of the world and  thought it sensible for us all to remain together in Ojai. 
    But Rosalind was restless. She had missed the past two summer camps  in Ommen. And Sara's death had left a great gap in her life. My father  usually seemed unaware of or unconcerned with the daily routine of our  lives and we saw him at most for dinner. But sometimes he was alert to a  particular discontent and then made an effort to be more of a companion  Алeven to the extent of walking with us. There was a steep climb behind  Arya Vihara called Twin Peaks. One day my parents and I did the four  miles to top. Such occasions of my father's companionship were rare  enough that I remember each distinctly. 
    On 20 June 1939, came another shock from Mr Robbie. It was written  coincidentally on my mother's birthday.

    Dearest Rozzie, 
    Deborah was buried today. She eluded the nurses and hanged herself  Sunday night just when the doctors were feeling much encouraged  about her recovery. 
    The last few times [ saw her she seemed so completely normal and  clear thinking that I began to think she might be able to shake off this  obsession of self-destruction and come back to Sarobia . . . However  I never really counted on her recovery for I felt the real damage had  been done years ago and that Sara's death only brought on an acute  attack. The tragedy really occurred twenty years ago when she fell  into Dr White's clutches and it is better to have her gone than to have  her spend her life in confinement and under a cloud of depression  and fear. 
    Robert had always claimed not to enjoy babies or very small children  but after two such terrible losses in one year, which he bore with outward  stoicism, he adopted both my mother and me as his closest family. 
    I should like very much to have a picture of you and a picture of  Radha or one of you both if you have no separate ones. If you haven't  had one taken with Radha you should do so before she begins to shoot  up and get gawky . . . 
    I miss you both very much for you are both close to my heart.  Affectionately,  ROBERT 
    Because of the war in Europe the Berkeleys could not make their annual  trips to Santa Barbara and in 1939 Molly had offered her ?(r)little cottage'  to us morАД|ђ or less indefinitely. It was seldom that my father came over.  That summer he went on his own to Europe, leaving my mother and  Krinsh to enjoy Molly's offer. Molly's house was a castle to me. |  delighted in the silver wallpaper in the master bedroom and the sunken  black marble tub. There were servants' quarters and lovely grounds that  came complete with an Italian gardener. His lunch, consisting ofa raw  egg, carefully pierced at either end, sucked out of 1ts shell, and gulped  down with his homemade rootbeer, fascinated me. 
    At first Rosalind had been appalled by the size of the house and  decided to decline Molly's offer, but Maria Huxley loved it as it was  very Italian in design and situation. She persuaded Rosalind to accept  the house and showed her how to close off much of it and thus cut  down on the upkeep. 
    165      Mr Robbie, who even through tragedy, had not lost his light touch 
    wrote: 
    August 29, 1939  Dearest Rozzie, ,  I am so glad you and Krinsh are roughing it so successfully in  Lady Berkeley's little shack! I should love to be there with you.  I wonder if you could send me the negatives of three of the snap  shots you sent me so I could have them enlarged?  One is the picture of you sitting on the railing and looking a good  deal like a young girl graduate dreaming of Clark Gable.  The second is of Radha and Krinsh . . . and the third is of Radha,  you and Beato . . . 
    We had many visitors, among them Jinarajadasa and the Huxleys,  who came quite often, and sometimes brought their friend, Bertrand  Russell. Russell was spending that year in Santa Barbara having, like  Aldous Huxley and Christopher Isherwood, decided that England was  not just then a fertile place for pacifists. At least he found kindred  spirits among us though each of our group had his own very individual  approach. 
    In Santa Barbara Rosalind found she was pregnant for the third time  and now, somewhat recklessly, considered having this child. She loved  children and had always wanted more. The threatened cancer had not  returned and she had more or less forgotten all about it. Being thirty-six,  however, she realized the risks of a pregnancy were even greater than  before and was therefore partly testing Krishna when she told him  her feelings. He certainly made it clear that he didn't think it a very  good idea for them to have this baby. He didn't go so far as to put  into words that she must have another abortion, but he never needed  words to make his wishes clear, and again she got on the bus alone, he  solicitous and loving as ever and giving her the same tender care when  she returned.
