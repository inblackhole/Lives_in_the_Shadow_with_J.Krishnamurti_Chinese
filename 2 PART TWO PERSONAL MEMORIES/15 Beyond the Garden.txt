15  Beyond the Garden 
    Although Raja had some devoted workers in the Hollywood office he  ran a one-man show and made himself responsible for every detail of  its multiple facets. Managing the various trust funds, keeping accounts,  figuring taxes, procuring visas, arranging Krishna's itineraries and talks  in half a dozen or more countries, were all tasks that Raja refused  to entrust to anyone else. But above all these in importance was  the meticulous editing of Krishna's manuscripts and verbatim talks.  Therefore, I saw very little of my father. His hours were not adapted to a  child's. He usually got dressed at mid-morning, often skipped lunch, put  in a brief appearance for dinner, and worked until four in the morning.  He seldom came to Ojai at all, preferring to stay in Hollywood with  my grandmother and Erma. Erma admired him tremendously and used  to wonder why my mother seemed to enjoy the company of so many  other people when she was married to a fascinating man like my father.  Of course she never had an inkling about Krinsh. To have known that  might have broken her heart, or then again she might have encompassed  such knowledge within her broad philosophical outlook. 
    In early 1935 Rosalind discovered she was pregnant. She had been  sternly warned that another childbirth would threaten her life. To  Krishna's obvious relief, she decided not to have his child Ал for reasons  of health rather than discretion. She went to an osteopathic friend in a  town east of Los Angeles. Only Krishna knew about this. He was very  compassionate and comforting, getting her on and off the bus, but not  offering to accompany her. Only he could understand the need for care  she would have for the next few days. She was quite ill but her family  attributed this to a mild attack of appendicitis, to which she was subject  and from which she recovered without medical help. If Krishna felt  any compunction for his responsibility in her ordeal, he did not show  it beyond being kind and loving; not even by taking more care in the  precautions he assured Rosalind he was using. (Realistically, it is hard to  imagine how the erstwhile world teacher could have come by these pre- cautions or how she could have been so naive as to believe he had.)

    Sophia was not as blind as everyone else appeared to be. They had all  been together in Hollywood for an unusually long time, under Sophia's  quiet observation. 
    ?(r)You should be wary of Krishna,?А└ she told Rosalind, ?(r)he could ruin  your marriage. Why don't you ask Raja to take you and Radha away 
    Ал even to South America?'  Sophia was not a meddler in the slightest degree, even when it came  to her daughters, but she loved Raja very much as a friend and as a  son-in-law. Her insight, for she had been told nothing and was never to  be told of the actual relationship between Krishna and Rosalind, might  have startled Rosalind, but after her recent ordeal she was in no mood  to go off with Raja to a foreign land or to leave Krishna, to whom she  was after all closest at that time. 
    Raja had his second sinus operation in late January 1935, and as  he still needed time to recuperate, he remained in California while  Rosalind, Krishna and I went to New York to the Logans, where talks  were scheduled at Sarobia. Photos taken at this gathering document on  film the love that Krinsh's face could reveal when he looked at my  mother. One wonders again how those hundreds of onlookers failed  to notice Ал or perhaps they did and their comments, if they made any,  never reached our ears, but I think that very unlikely. 
    I did not like getting into trouble and very seldom did, but that year  at Sarobia I once again fell foul of Mr Robbie. There were at least twenty  cats who had the run of the whole house. I knew better than to affront  Mr Robbie's favourite Pack Wack, huge and irritable and always sitting  on his desk, glaring at interrupting little girls. But one day I found a tiny  kitten all alone in the garden and carefully picked it up to return it to its  mother. I had seen the mother pick it up by the scruff of its neck and it  hadn't looked too happy about that. I thought the tail would be better.  Suddenly Mr Robbie bore down on me and, taking me firmly but not  unkindly by the hand, delivered me to my mother. By then he was  furious and scolded my mother even more than me, again not believing  her when she tried to explain that [ meant no harm. [ remember feeling  comforted that she would defend me, for she was generally the strictest  person in my life, though I never remember any harshness. It is certain  that no one would have thought of laying even the mildest hand on me.  Indians were culturally opposed to disciplining small children and the  high-minded Westerners among my adults refrained, not only because  I was ostensibly being raised by Krinsh, but because I believe my Indian  features evoked an image of the suffering Indian masses. Anger retreated  before their compassion. Of course my mother suffered from no such 
    133  
 
                   
 
      cultural delusions and would put me in my room to think about my 
    misdeeds, a punishment [ found quite mortifying. 
    For the most part, some of my happiest memories centre around  Sarobia. The Logans loved Alice in Wonderland and had made a chess- board garden with a Humpty Dumpty sitting on the wall above it,  Sarobia also abounded in strange and wonderful living characters. There  was the artist Blossom Farley, an old man whom some took to be a bit  off, but he knew how to gather edible mushrooms and lived in a little  cottage behind the mansion. Sometimes he saw brownies and fairies  sitting on his mushrooms. I never saw these, but I did learn from him  to find the tiny turtles emerging from their eggs and to listen at night  for the screech owl that sounded like a witch laughing. The big house  had dozens of clocks, most with chimes, all set to ring harmoniously in  succession. Mr Robbie spent the better part of each Sunday winding and  setting them. In this task I seemed to be his welcome companion. 
    Krinsh was at his happiest when surrounded by small groups of  intelligent and serious listeners. Everyone at the Sarobia gatherings  was there by invitation, unlike the camps at Ojai and Ommen. The  atmosphere around Krinsh was charged with many elements, but in  those days it was particularly charged with a sense of love Ал usually  unsentimental and undemanding with a few unwelcome and quickly  discouraged exceptions. It was my mother's unfortunate duty to deflect  from Krinsh those probably unbalanced and positively pestiferous devo- tees who inevitably turned up wherever he was. 
    In late March, Raja and Byron Casselberry, a friend and helper, having  joined Krishna on the east coast, sailed for Rio de Janeiro and Rosalind  returned to California with me. It was on this South American trip  that Krishna wrote Rosalind a series of his most tender love letters.  The habit of writing to her every day, as had once been his habit with  Lady Emily, would continue through all their separations. 
    Strangely enough Krishna was also able to focus his attention and 
    his affection on Raja. His relationship with Rosalind did not seem 
    to affect his behaviour toward Raja. He accepted Raja's love and 
    commitment toward him without question. Just as Lady Emily had 
    noticed a ?(r)divided personality' and Mrs Besant, with quite different 
    implication, had granted him a dual consciousness, one day both Raja 
    and Rosalind would wonder if Krishna were in some way more than one 
    person. But their questioning was still far off. At this time, Raja merely 
    struggled to keep his equilibrium in the face of Krishna's changeable 
    personality, which led to serious misunderstandings between them and 
    with others. Quarrels due to what Raja remembers as Krishna's frequent 
    134

    lying and undercutting of him, Krishna's agreeing to proposals behind  Raja's back, and making promises that could not be kept, became so  severe after several months in South America that once Krishna, who  could only take so much criticism, slapped Raja. This was not the only  time that would happen, but it was the first. Before the tour, already  cut short, was over, without explanation to anyone, Raja left Krishna  in the care of Byron Casselberry, who was translating the talks into  Spanish. Even Rosalind was not informed of Raja's sudden change  in plans. On 5 August 1935 she wrote to Blanche Matthias repeating  Krishna's explanation: 
    Dearest Blanche, 
    . Krishnaji, himself made up his mind to cancel the Central 
    American countries as he felt there was very little use in going to 
    each one of them for only a week. That is the only reason they are 
    returning earlier. In Rio he stayed for two months and the first few 
    weeks were spent in discussing all the old 1deas of Theosophy, before 
    he was able to say what he had to say. 
    One might surmise from this letter that whatever problems lay  between Krishna and Raja were exacerbated by Krishna's dissension  with the local Theosophists. Nitya's estrangement from his brother ten  years before was now reflected in Raja's disapproval of Krishna's critical  attitude toward those who still made up a large part of his audience.  Krishna had convinced himself that it was the Theosophists who had  turned away from him and cast him out of Adyar. The Theosophists  saw him as having left them in a strange limbo. They had been told  that no matter what he did they should follow him because he was  the world teacher, and they wondered where to turn when he rejected  that role. While Raja sympathized with Krishna's criticism of many  Theosophlcal beliefs, he felt that those who were left in this state of  confusion deserved more patience and understanding than Krishna was  willing to give them. 
    When I was still quite small, we spent a good deal of time in Hollywood.  My mother had a full life there, playing tennis and going to parties,  often leaving me with my grandmother. She was very good to my  grandmother, driving her several times a week to visit her elderly  lady friends, and the three of us went shopping together on Fridays  at Bullock's Wilshire and had lunch in its tea-room. There were also  weekly lunches with the Ingelmans, with whom Krinsh always stayed 
    135      when in Hollywood. Hilda had a great fat black cat and a large  garden behind the house with beehives, which provided all of us  with generous amounts of honey. She was always telling me that  she was the first person to have ever seen me, even before my mother  had. The Ingelmans, with no children of their own, made me feel  was a good substitute. I adored them both, with their lovely melodic  Swedish accent and incredible kindness. I do not believe that in their  eyes bad people existed. Everyone who came their way seemed to be  loved and dear to them. They addressed both me and my mother as  ?(r)little darling'. 
    My aunt Erma was included in this circle and so was Louis Zalk, for  whom she now worked. He had lost a child some years before and had  never recovered from the grief of this loss until he met Krinsh, who,  he felt, gave him back his ability to enjoy life. Everyone could see that  he and Erma were very devoted to each other. 
    Rosalind's friendship with the Van der Leeuws had led to a deep  interest in architecture with considerable exposure to the Bauhaus  movement. She had seen the Van der Leeuws' exceptional modern  factory in Rotterdam. Kees Van der Leeuw had introduced Rosalind  to the young Austrian architect, Richard Neutra, who had moved to  America in the 1920s. 
    Rosalind was fascinated to see Los Angeles through their eyes, espe- cially the site for the new University of California campus in Westwood,  of which Kees and Neutra were both very critical. With their Bauhaus  taste, they disliked the old-fashioned neo-gothic brick. Rosalind asked  Neutra to design a small flat above her mother's house on Gower Street,  so that she and Raja would have their own quarters when they were in  Hollywood. Neutra and she became good friends, although they had  vociferous arguments about colour, the one aspect of his taste with  which she was in disagreement. Neutra was to comment later that  she was the one client with whom he could not always have his way.  But the apartment was a great success. Raja now had privacy when  in Hollywood, where he mostly was, and they could give parties on  the large terrace without imposing on Sophia and Erma down below.  They were, after all, both still in their early thirties. 
    During the past few years Rosalind had also become friends of the  German movie director William Dieterle and his wife. One day we  were invited to their house to meet Keiro, the famous palmist who  had forecast many eminent futures with remarkable accuracy. He had  predicted a decade earlier that the Prince of Wales would never be King  of England. The Dieterles had taken palm prints of Krishna, Raja and 
    136  
 
                   
Beyond the Garden 
    Rosalind and shown them, scattered among others of their friends, to  Keiro, who immediately picked those three from the pile and said,  ?(r)Who are these people, for I have never before seen three hands so  strongly linked?' There were no names on the front side of the prints  and when he discovered who they belonged to he wanted to meet them  all, but Krishna and Raja were still in South America. 
    Keiro told Rosalind that she had a sign on her palm that indicated  a possible injury or death from a jealous woman. He said Mrs Besant  had the same sign and that in ancient Egypt girls with such signs were  put, for their own safety, in temples. ?(r)I would not be surprised to pick  up a paper one day and see that you had been murdered, the same might  have happened to Mrs Besant.' 
    Mrs Besant's life had ended peacefully at Adyar two years before and  Rosalind was not unduly alarmed by this gloomy prophecy. But Keiro  also told her she would soon be asked to take a long flight and that she  should refuse to go for the plane would crash. When we returned to  Gower Street there was a cable waiting for her from Raja asking her  to meet them in Mexico. Fortunately for her, his quarrel with Krishna  must have occurred right after he sent it. Another cable soon arrived  cancelling the plan. Perhaps because Rosalind wasn't on it, there was  no report ofa plane crash. 
    Dev Meyers, the same friend who had rescued me from the Peeping  Tom, was so impressed that he went to Keiro for a reading too but  suffered a grave disappointment, for Keiro said practically nothing.  When Rosalind privately questioned the palmist and explained how  disappointed her friend had been, Keiro said he had indeed seen a great  deal, that Major Myers would die in a few years in a plane accident.  He never told people such news when it was inevitable. Several years  later, Dev crashed flying alone in an Air Force plane. 
    In 1935, again through Kees, Rosalind met the newly arrived German  actress Luise Reiner, who asked Rosalind if she would help her with  English as she particularly liked her accent. This would mean spending  a lot of time with Luise; it seemed for a while that we were all one  family for we were together almost every day. Luise took me around  with her to the studio. As my dark hair matched her colouring much  more than Rosalind's, the rumour spread Ал and Luise did nothing to  deny it Ал that I was her illegitimate daughter. I knew nothing about  the rumour and would scarcely have understood it, but I found the  stares | received from Luise's movie crowd more disturbing than the  stares around Krinsh, though my natural shyness found more refuge  in his reticence than in Luise's evident enjoyment of publicity. 
    137  
 
                   
 
    Luise too wanted to be read by Keiro and was dismayed on being told  that she would go straight to the top and win more honours than anyone  in Hollywood ever had and then fall like a rocket to the bottom. (Luise  won three Oscars in a row and then disappeared from the Hollywood  scene as well as ours.) 
    Also that year Max Reinhardt came to America to make a film of  A Midsummer Night's Dream. William Dieterle was the co-director.  The cast was a most improbable mixture: Mickey Rooney, Olivia de  Havilland, Dick Powell and James Cagney. To these Dieterle wanted  to add me as the little Indian Prince. My father was in South America,  so he had nothing to say about it. But my grandmother, who seldom  expressed disapproval except where my welfare was concerned, was  very much opposed. Fortunately for my mother the problem was  gracefully resolved when I came down with tonsillitis that appeared  at first to be mumps. But Mr Dieterle allowed us on the set to watch  the filming. 
    Hollywood was a world apart from Krishna for both Raja and  Rosalind. With her looks and elegant style in clothes (most of which  she made herself), her Indian husband, and Indian-looking child, and  close association with an Indian sage, she presented a certain exotic  appeal which was not lost on the Hollywood of that era. The Dieterles  were more than acquaintances and she enjoyed many years of close  friendship with them. Every Christmas they sent their chauffeur to  Ojai with a carload of Christmas presents for me, all of which Rosalind  passed on to less fortunate children without my being aware of this  excessive bounty. 
    Through the Dieterles Rosalind met other Hollywood personalities,  including the film music composer William Blanke and director John  Sturges, most of whom had swimming pools, much more rare in  those days, and into which I invariably fell and had to be fished 
    out. 
    Rosalind's former tennis days stood her in good stead too for she 
    found new friendships through this sport with, among others, the 
    composer Arnold Schoenberg and the screenwriter Dorothy Arznar. 
    Dorothy introduced her to Galka Scheyer, a woman who was to have 
    a considerable influence on Rosalind, for she encouraged her to take up 
    painting. 
    Galka had come to America in 1924 to introduce both the paintings 
    and the ideas of the ?(r)Blue Four?А└ artists, Feininger, Jawlensky, Kandinsky 
    and Paul Klee, already well known in Europe. She played a considerable 
    role in awakening American taste to modern art. I had my first painting 
    138  
 
                   
Beyond the Garden 
    experience with her and thoroughly enjoyed her method of putting water  colours on already wet paper, allowing the paint its own freedom of  design. Although she preferred to teach children, she was convinced that  Rosalind must paint and was then sufficiently impressed by her work  to keep many of Rosalind's paintings in her collection. She loved her  sense of colour and if Neutra had done anything to shake my mother's  confidence, which I doubt, Galka would certainly have restored it.  remember Galka as short, wide and large-headed with red hair and the  loudest voice I had ever heard. Her forceful and loving personality can 
    be seen in the following excerpts (not chronologically placed) of her  letters to Rosalind during the ten years of their friendship until Galka's  death in 1945. 
    Dearest Rosaline, 
    Since I am anxious for you to continue to paint with me I have  arranged to have the grown up painting class on Fridays. I expect  you to come if it is possible for you . . . 
    I hope you will start soon. You are an artist and they are born to  create and not only have duties to care for others . . . 
    Dearest Rosaline,  I find in my book by Huxley Means and Ends (Ends and Means)  notes of following pages in the back of it.  Page 4, 44, 48, 158, 113, 313, 214, 278, 296, 309, 318, 361,  362.  I marked them in disagreement. So if you like read them and see  what you think about them. 
    It was lovely at your house. We enjoyed it very much. You are  a darling and you are very much loved by us and by me because I  need to know that you exist . . . 
    Dearest Rosaline, 
    Today I''m writing to tell you the tiny Puff, the smallest and favorite  of the two dogs, is staying with me with the purpose to go to Radha  when she comes back. I want her to have that dog. It is half the  size of all the others, vivid and lively and I think it is waiting to  go back to Radha and therefore pretends not to grow up and stay  a small baby. I really have not the heart to give that dog away. As |  said I want Radha to have it, except you would be really opposed to  it. If you think because you move around so much, it would bring  difficulties, I do not believe so. You can always return the dog to 
    139      me and Radha can have the dog with the understanding as she had  before that it will be for the time she will stay in Ojai. Let me know  if you agree to this. 
    Our travelling during those years was indeed extensive and probably  for this reason, as Galka feared, I did not get the little Puff.  Beatrice Wood often attended Galka's classes too. I called her Beato 
    Ал a nickname that became her signature on her pottery. She and  my mother would remain close for the rest of their lives and she  eventually moved to Ojai right across the street from Arya Vihara.  Beato was profoundly interested and influenced by what Krinsh had  to say, but was not drawn to him as a person as she was to both  of my parents. She dressed in an exotic and colourful manner, with  loads of heavy silvery jewellery, full skirts and large hats, all of which  was in strange contrast to her very distinguished ?(r)main line' accent.  Beato, later to be called the ?(r)Mama of Dada', knew everyone of  interest in the art and theatre world. Even when she ultimately achieved  fame as a foremost ceramicist, Beato remained a charming and utterly  unassuming person, full of wit as well as a vivid and true sense of what  was real.  Raja too had his circle of friends in Hollywood, many the same as  those of Rosalind, but some more special to him. He was a first-rate  chess player and this gave occasion for many evenings out. The amount  of social activity meant neither of them really suffered from loneliness in  their often separate lives. Though basically shy, Raja had a charmingly  naughty streak that delighted his friends, especially Beato, who felt  she had learned from him the importance of truth and of striving  for perfection. But Raja's jokes often seemed to shock Rosalind. This  naturally dampened Raja's fun and too often their evenings out together  ended in disharmony. 
    Rosalind adjusted easily from her life in Hollywood to the equal  amount of time she spent in Ojai when Krishna was in America. As  the office work was at that time all centred in Hollywood, it was  difficult for Raja to get away. This left Rosalind to run Arya Vihara  and see to Krishna's welfare while he was in Ojai. 
    Krinsh had returned exhausted from South America. Rosalind had not  been told of his quarrel with Raja so she had no reason to feel caught  in the two men's conflict. She only knew that the steady flow of letters  from Krishna had reaffirmed his love for her. In late winter of 1936,  the three of us without my father went to Carmel for a month's rest, 
    140  
 
                   
Beyond the Garden 
    staying as usual at Peter Pan Lodge. Winter in Carmel is even more  beautiful than summer, for the weather is clear and enormous waves  rise and crash over the rocks at Point Lobos. The sea-lions bark and  the sea is deep sapphire. 
    It was not long before Rosalind was again pregnant. This time the  decision as to what to do about it was taken out of her hands. One  day in Hollywood Krishna and Raja had one of their more terrible  arguments in front of Rosalind and Sophia. Rosalind was not involved  and can no longer remember what it was about, but she was highly  distressed that the two men would shout at each other in front of her  mother. They must have forgotten her presence for it was very rare  for either of them, but especially Krishna, to expose this side of their  relationship to anyone. Leaving me in Hollywood, as she sometimes  did, Rosalind and Krishna left that evening to drive back to Ojai. She  had been deeply shaken and upset by the quarrel and was convinced  that it was the cause of her losing on the way to Ojai, in an isolated  field, this second baby with Krishna. He was, as usual, tender, kind  and loving and helped her as best he could. 
    It took some time, however, for Rosalind to recover fully from this  ordeal and Krishna remained solicitous throughout the spring. He  insisted that she should not over-do it, that she get enough rest,  and he spent time reading to her to keep her quiet, and he played  with me. Of course I did not understand what was wrong with my  mother, but I remember sharing Krinsh's concern. 
    This much loving care was rarely to be enjoyed by Rosalind. She had  strong physical endurance and a high threshold of pain. She never cared  for her own comfort, yet had to adapt to living with and caring for  two men of extreme physical sensitivity. She always had a remarkable  ability to discard and forget what troubled her, to see the world as  she wished it to be. However, when faced with recalling an actual  memory she could bring it back fully but seemed to set herself apart  as though it were another person who had lived through it. It may  be that she simply had a remarkable capacity for acceptance of certain  things like pain and death as natural and inevitable circumstances. She  still had Krishna's love and their relationship would continue unde- tected. For the most part the three of them contained their contentious  moments in a private realm. In these earlier years they all felt a very  real bond of affection. It was this bond that made them subject to  idealization by both friends and strangers. Rosalind wrote a letter to  Blanche which reflects a period of harmony at yet another gathering  at Sarobia. 
    141  
 
                   
 
    June 28 ??36 
    Dear Blanche, . 
    You really should have been here it has all been so lovely, and 
    everyone seemed to enjoy it so much in such a deep sense. Also 
    the discussions which were held every other day, were the best 1 
    have ever heard. Krishnaji gave two splendid talks in New York and 
    three here. They were corrected and sent off the next day. Rajagopal 
    said they were well done too. Altogether there were five talks and 
    so many have said they have never heard him speak so well before. 
    I think so too. In a few days we sail. 
    At five years old I was sailing to Europe for the second time. The  Ommen Camp was an exciting place for me. Krinsh sometimes let  me sit next to him in the big tent where the discussions were held;  while it was hard to sit there the whole time, I believe I managed to  do so. There were other children about, but mostly I was, as usual,  in an adult world. 
    Sometimes those two summers at Ommen mingle in my mind and [  am not certain to which one specific memories belong. There are visions  of the Indian sisters of the Sarabhai family taking long hot showers in  the communal shower room at the end of the hall and my fascination  at their graceful winding in and out of their saris. 
    I remember the great white house called Henan in which we stayed,  surrounded by people who lavished on me the love and gratitude they  felt toward Krinsh but were unable to express directly to him because  of his precept against devotees. My mother waged a constant battle to  prevent me from becoming spoiled. 
    There was a little seat attached to the back of Krinsh's bicycle for  me. Krinsh biked me around the beautiful pine-forested grounds, past  the barn with little piglets and the fat pink sow Ал probably my first  sight of that species, Eerde castle with its moat and swans, the camp  fire circle in the sand dunes. I had been sternly warned never to take  my feet off the foot rests. One day curiosity got the better of me and  I lifted my right foot off the rest. It was instantly caught up in the  spokes throwing us both off the bicycle. My heel was cut to the bone.  Krinsh was adept in a physical crisis. I can remember feeling no fear  and much comfort as he carried me back to my mother. I was laid  up for some time after that, but was showered with attention from  the scores of followers in the camp who were much concerned with  the well-being of a creature so close to Krinsh. Attention was not my  sole prerogative for long. Sara Logan was suddenly stricken by a severe 
    142  
 
                   
Beyond the Garden 
    attack of appendicitis and needed care. She was to die a few years later  from complications resulting from the ensuing surgery. 
    After the camp, my mother had flown to London with Krinsh for a  short rest, leaving me again at Ommen with plenty of ladies to help  my father look after me. I can remember one morning awakening in  my crib, which was covered with a white net, and secing a large red  rose lying over my head. I do not remember feeling sad, just looking  at the rose and knowing it was there instead of my mother. 
    It had been an exhausting session for my mother, trying to keep a  laid-up child happy and to look after the seriously ill Sara. She was  confined to the house and had even missed the lectures which had been  attended by nearly a thousand people. She was also depressed by the  cloud of impending war. Like Mr Robbie, she had pacifism in her genes  and was proud of her grandfather, Carl Waldo, who had risked being  stoned on the street corners of Buffalo to speak against the Civil War.  Along with others of her generation, she had believed the First World  War would end all wars and her father's friendship with Woodrow  Wilson and his serving on Wilson's Peace Commission had heightened  her optimism. It was now evident that peace was fast sinking beneath  one horizon as war rose over another. 
    Those times were rare when I was left with my father. I remember  them as very special. From him I learned a different sort of knowledge  than from Krinsh. My father taught me to tell the time, to use numbers,  and to take an interest in good handwriting. He read me stories from  the Indian Jataka tales and from the Bible. His gifts to me were usually  books. We never played hide and seek, but we played indoor games  like Chinese chequers. He did not care what I ate or when I went to  bed and put very few demands on my behaviour as long as I did not  disturb anyone. It was he who somehow instilled in me the importance  of being truthful and the undesirability of hypocrisy. 
    After one of his operations he had lost fecling in his right hand, which  made it difficult for him to do many things Алbraid my hair or tie shoelaces.  By sheer will power he did not let it affect his beautiful handwriting. 
    When my mother and Krinsh returned from England we all  had a holiday in Villars in Switzerland. We stayed in a charm- ing old hotel, at which a solicitous devotee, who had obtained a  miraculous cure at the Bircher-Benner Clinic in Zurich, had already  established herself. She showed the cook how to make Bircher  muesli, a then unknown nutritional marvel and persuaded Krinsh  that we must all eat it every morning. To this day hotels all over  Switzerland and even the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong serve muesli.

    After this unusual breakfast, Krinsh and [ took walks every morning,  watching the cows with varying sizes of Swiss cow-bells going to  pasture. Krinsh would rub his head with pine needles because he  thought it good for his hair. (Later he would discover he was allergic  to pine needles.) 
    Our association with Krinsh led to encounters with an incredible variety  of people. Some accepted us merely as part of his entourage. Many  became close friends of us all or one or the other of my parents or  myself for reasons that extended beyond Krinsh's sphere. 
    Among them was Molly Berkeley, an American from the Lowell  family, who divorced an American husband with whom she was bored  and later married the Eighth and last Earl of Berkeley, whom she had  met at a country weekend in England. Her hostess warned her that  there would be a guest who did not like Americans. This guest, Lord  Berkeley, arrived, saw Molly across the room and came straight over  to meet her. He said, ?(r)I have a question to ask you.?А└ He was suddenly  interrupted and didn't have another chance to talk to her that evening.  A few weeks later they met again at a hunt and he was impressed by  Molly's superb horsemanship. He asked her to dine with him and at  the end of the evening he reminded her of the question he had been  about to ask when they first met. 
    ?(r)I'd like to ask it now,?А└ he said. ?АсWill you marry me?'  ?(r)I will,?А└ she replied, ?(r)but you will have to live in my little cottage in  Santa Barbara, California, because I cannot live anywhere else.' 
    As a peer whose ancestry went back to the Norman Conquest, Lord  Berkeley was known to have thought it beneath him to entertain the  King and Queen of England, whom he called ?(r)those Huns'. He said  that, of course, he could not live in Santa Barbara. So they parted.  When Molly arrived back in America, she was met at the ship with  great bouquets of roses and a cable declaring. ?(r)I cannot live without  you. [ will live in Santa Barbara.' 
    They spent a few summers in what she called her cottage but which  was in fact a sizeable villa on a hilltop above Montecito. Lord Berkeley  had it painted a dreadful shade of Kelly green, his hunting colour. As  he wished to give large dinner parties starting at nine in the evening  and in the style to which he was accustomed, and as it was not possible  to find staff in Santa Barbara who would fulfil these exacting demands  and hours, Molly found it increasingly difficult to live there. In 1939 the  war in Europe prevented them from returning to America and Molly  offered the house to us; we lived there for six months.

    I never met Lord Berkeley, but my mother stayed at Berkeley Castle  before I was born and played chess with him every evening. When I  visited the castle as a tourist many years later I hoped that my mother,  always a vegetarian, had not been told of the ancient custom of throwing  cows' carcasses down a pit in the prisoners' wing to asphyxiate the  inmates by the stench; or of the horrible death of Edward II, who failed  to be asphyxiated in time. People with Theosophical backgrounds who  pride themselves on being sensitive to vibrations would not rest easy  in Berkeley Castle. 
    We remained friends with Molly until her death in Assisi over a decade  ago. On a last visit there she told me how, with one short sentence,  Krinsh had helped her. She had complained to him of dissatisfaction  with her life: the great castle in England to run, the villa in Rome, it  was all too much with the servants and entertaining. ?(r)Either leave or  put up with it,?А└ he told her, and that was all it took to enable her to  settle down peacefully with her husband until his death. Alone during  the war, she was bombed in London and was left for two days buried  in a cellar. She became a Roman Catholic after that and retired to Assisi,  her final home. An American priest was there the day I visited her shortly  before her death. Suddenly she turned to me and said, ?(r)Krishnamurti has  more wisdom in his little finger than the whole Catholic church put  together.' I shall never forget the priest's expression. 
    In 1936, after Villars, Sara Logan joined us and we all stayed with  Molly in her villa in Rome. I remember a great dining table with a  footman behind each chair and things being handed to me before I  knew I wanted them. 
    My parents were quite convinced that summer of the great danger  to civilization. My mother did not know it would be our last summer  in Europe for many years, but she must have sensed it for I can  still remember her taking me to the Sistine chapel and impressing  Michelangelo's paintings on me as ifI might never see them again.  I returned twenty years later, but I still remember that first viewing  most vividly, especially the hand of God reaching toward Adam. 
    As children have their own sense of the important, I remember  equally well my first giraffe, which I saw in Rome Zoo, commenting,  to the amusement of my adults, that its eyes were like Rukmini's but  its legs were like Krinsh's. 
    We were taken to tea one afternoon at the castle of Count Orsini,  the last of his line. I promptly disappeared down a spiral staircase into  the dungeons, causing consternation to my parents, but evidently not 
    145      annoying the old Count for he gave me a carved wooden dog-clock  which still ticks intermittently. 
    Sara Logan sailed back to America with my mother and me. We  passed the rock of Gibraltar, another landmark that was thoroughly  impressed upon me. The voyage was so rough that Sara and I were  the only passengers on deck. One day a careless deck-hand left open  the guard rail at the rear of the ship. He had failed to notice one little  girl and a lone lady who had survived the rough seas to wander up on  deck together. I eluded Sara's attention for a nearly fatal instant and  hung fascinated over the open drop to the churning waters above the  propeller. The Conte di Savoia was a very large ship and I must have  been several storeys above the water. I never forgot Sara's calm but  firm grip on my arm as she pulled me away from the precipice and  led me, without a trace of anger, to safety. She was too fair to blame  me but I can now imagine the fright I gave her. It was on this voyage,  left solely in her company, that I developed a still deeper attachment  to this person who had taken both me and my mother into her heart  as her own family. She would be my first loss and one I would never  forget.
